<h2> .DGN variant # </h2>
<p> A DGN file is a 2D / 3D drawing created by various CAD software such as MicroStation and Intergraph Interactive Graphics Design System. It can be saved in one of two formats: the standard Intergraph file format (ISFF) or the new V8 DGN standard. DGN files are commonly used to save construction projects for highways, bridges and buildings. </p>
<p> DGN files can be opened by Bentley Systems MicroStation and Bentley's free viewer. The DGN format is also supported by several other third party software such as Autodesk AutoCAD and IMSI TurboCAD. DGN files can be converted to the more versatile .DWG format using AutoCAD LDT. </p>
<p> NOTE. The DGN extension is not suitable for "design". </p>
