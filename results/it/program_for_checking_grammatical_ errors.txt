<h1> Check spelling, grammar and punctuation online </h1>
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> The service allows you to check online spelling, grammar and partial punctuation of texts for free. </p>
<p> Possible errors in the text are highlighted in color. To learn more about a specific error, hover the pointer over the required area, a pop-up window will contain a description of the error and options for fixing it. </p>
<h2> How to write correctly </h2>
<p> Spelling in translation from Latin means "to write correctly", and punctuation is "point". But their observance does not mean good writing of the text, since there is also grammar - this is the correct word formation and the construction of sentences. In addition, we must not forget about the style and other wisdom. But that later. For starters, it's best to focus only on spelling and punctuation. </p>
<p> There are a few working tips in total: </p>
<p> <strong> Read more. </strong> At the same time, it is necessary to borrow from the library not only fiction, but also educational literature, since some phrases and words are found only in popular science publications. In dramatic works you will meet more beautiful techniques of literary speech and rules for constructing sentences. And with the help of scientific books, you can consolidate various specific words and terms. </p>
<p> <strong> Give preference to Soviet books. </strong> As the authors, editors and book lovers say, modern editing is in decline. This is due to the fact that the pursuit of profit forces us to reduce costs. Including finding inconsistencies in the text. As a result, modern books are full of errors of various sizes and stupidity. </p>
<p> <strong> Learn. </strong> Study, study and study again - these words of the leader of the proletariat are fully applicable to the Russian language. Since the days of the Egyptian papyrus, no alternative to cramming has been invented. That being said, remember that the reinforcement of a rule occurs when you try to remember and apply it, and not just read from a book. </p>
<p> <strong> Train. </strong> Human memory is arranged in such a way that after a week we forget 50% of what we have memorized, and after 2-3 months - 70% or more. The only way to memorize a rule is to start using it. And for this you need to practice, but so that you can immediately check what you have written. Numerous online Russian language simulators will help you with this. </p>
<p> Oddly enough, just by learning all the rules, you will not write correctly. And it's not a bad memory. It's just that people's attention is designed so that you can 100% concentrate on just one thought. That is, a person is able to either compose a sentence or check it grammatically. Therefore, you do not need to cross a snake and a hedgehog. Write first, check later. </p>

<p> TOP programs for checking spelling and punctuation. </p>
<p> The appearance of numerous typos and spelling errors in the text is a frequent occurrence when working with large volumes of text, resulting from loss of concentration. Of course, utilities for checking the grammar of the Russian language cannot always determine the correctness of spelling, because they do not feel and do not take into account the context. Even one comma, put grammatically correctly, but in the wrong place of a sentence, can completely turn the whole meaning of what was said, and sometimes the same text carries the opposite meaning and does with the same punctuation. Such subtleties of the Russian language are captured only by a living person, and then only by its native speaker. </p>
<p> The topic of misunderstanding the exceptional features of the syntax that does not lend itself to the logic of foreigners is inexhaustible, and services for checking the quality of the text stumble over sayings with a controversial interpretation. Also, many slang expressions are often absent in program dictionaries, which makes it impossible to perfectly correct what was written. At the same time, the use of such software allows you to pay attention to most of the mistakes made in the texts and eliminate them. Authors' helpers can be integrated into a text editor, additionally downloaded to a computer or used online. </p>
<h2> The best tools for checking errors in text </h2>
<p> Today there are many services that check the correctness of spelling, but in many of them, even with the detection of obvious errors, it is full of seams. Moreover, correctly stated sentences are often regarded as inadmissible in speech. This is due to the scarcity of vocabulary and a lack of understanding of some lexical chains, as in the example of the comprehension of the Russian language by foreigners. </p>
<p> <iframe src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOOG6LyBMaA?feature=oembed"> </iframe> </p>
<p> The programs for correcting errors in the text are able to cope with the grammar check with a bang, but the analysis of the placement of punctuation marks in the text is implemented in the services rather primitively. Often, the user is only asked to separate introductory words and simple syntactic constructions with commas, and when faced with sentences complicated by a large number of turns, programs no longer see the need for additional writing elements and often, without hesitation, ask to simplify writing. Let's consider the most popular and adequate tools for working with text error checking, of course, with Russian language support. </p>
<h3> Microsoft Word </h3>
<p> The well-known editor from the Microsoft Office package is equipped with quite rich functionality. Among the many options in Word, there is a built-in multi-language literacy checker. The editor includes automatic underlining of identified errors, which is very convenient, since it allows the user to instantly correct the shortcomings, thereby making corrections along the way, and not at the end of it. If the function is inactive, go to the "Review" tab and go to the "Spelling Options", where we tick the necessary items, and best of all - everything except the exceptions section. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://nastroyvse.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Proverka-v-Microsoft-Word.jpg" /> </p>
<p> Spelling errors are underlined with a wavy line in red, and grammatical ones - in green. When you select a word or sentence, you can call the context menu and, by selecting the item "Grammar" or "Spelling" (depending on the nature of the error), to clarify why the editor does not like this spelling, replacement options will also be offered, but, of course, not a fact. Microsoft Word also has a convenient function for adding words to the dictionary, after which the editor will not underline them as an error. You can also skip a specific word or sentence, including throughout the document in case of repetition. The ability to customize autocorrect to your own requirements is available, the program automatically corrects errors in the text according to the selected parameters (replaces characters when accidentally pressed, puts capital letters at the beginning of a line, etc.). You can write in any style you want, adjusting the options you want, including using common expressions or expressive vocabulary, if necessary. </p>
<h3> Text.ru </h3>
<p> The online service Tekst.ru allows you to check the quality of the text for uniqueness, spelling errors, as well as perform SEO analysis. The resource is quite good and is used by representatives of various professions to create high-quality content. At the same time, punctuation is very tight here, but rather its check, apparently, is not provided at all, since only the simplest mistakes are underlined, for example, in the absence of punctuation marks in front of prepositions. Commas can be put completely out of place, although after each word, text.ru will not notice this - checked. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://nastroyvse.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Proverka-v-Text-en.jpg" /> </p>

The service will offer a choice of authorization options. Spelling provides a package of free checks for 6 thousand characters for review, after which the services are available with a commercial subscription. </p>

All found gaps in grammar, spelling, punctuation, as well as stylistic inconsistencies will be highlighted in the checked text in different colors. The spelling does an excellent job of checking, allowing you to identify even non-obvious errors, and combines the functions of several services. So the small price to pay for using a program that checks the text against all parameters is nothing compared to the benefits it gets. </p>

<p> Blindly relying on services and text checking programs is not worth it, the technologies are not yet so perfect as to surpass the human intellect that created these very auxiliary tools. The only exceptions are some individuals, who are better off unconditionally trusting the software, without even asking unnecessary questions. Unfortunately, the great desire to write pushes completely illiterate people to numerous publications, but there are no obstacles to this yet. At the same time, even for an experienced author who is literate, such tools also often become a lifeline. The main thing is to carry out the check reasonably and carefully in order to avoid such incidents as with the notorious T9. </p>
