<h1> How to view guests on VK? </h1>
<p> In the modern world, social networks are an integral part of the lives of many people. Communication, photography, business, news, games are concentrated there. Over the past years, VKontakte has been very popular - users of this network are multiplying like mushrooms after rain. A person is a collective being who is sometimes interested in how others treat him and who comes to look at his page? Let's try to figure out if VK makes it possible to recognize its guests? </p>
<h2> Can I see guests on VKontakte? </h2>
<p> Everyone is used to the fact that in Odnoklassniki you can quickly and easily see who viewed the profile, however, VKontakte has a completely different policy. The creators want to protect people's right to privacy and freedom, so if you want to, you won't find the magic "guests" button. And in fact, few people want to be able to track every step of theirs, because some even specially install applications to sit VK offline. Several years ago, the VKontakte support team purposefully published a post explaining why the network functionality lacks the ability to show page visitors. </p>

<p> However, as the saying goes, "curiosity killed the cat." The desire to obtain information about guests is present among many, therefore there are still loopholes. We'll discuss them below. </p>
<h2> How to recognize guests on VKontakte? </h2>
<p> Let's look at two simple ways to find out who is interested in your page. </p>
<h3> By likes and comments </h3>
<p> The most honest, convenient and understandable option. Look at the likes and comments that were left on your page by other users. It's easy to do - click on the bell-shaped icon representing "Notifications". All recent actions will open, one way or another affecting the account owner. You can see who has commented on your posts, liked, shared, etc. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-14.png" /> </p>
<p> <strong> If the "Notifications" is empty, but you know that there were comments and likes, then, most likely, notifications are trite disabled. It is easy to solve the problem: </strong> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Click on your name in the upper right corner of the page and select "Settings". </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3-11.png" /> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> General settings will open. Go to Notifications by clicking on them in the list on the right. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/4-11.png" /> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Find the "Feedback" block and see which options are disabled. The screenshot shows that notifications about "Like", "Comments" and "Answers to stories" have been removed. To enable them, you must click on "Disabled" and select the appropriate option from the list that appears. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5-11.png" /> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> You don't need to save anything, the settings will be applied automatically. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3> By deleting an account </h3>
<p> Don't get scared ahead of time, you won't have to delete anything! However, having performed some actions in this direction, you can find out who is visiting your VK page. A life hack for obtaining information about visitors by deleting an account is as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Find your name in the upper right part of the screen, click on this area and go to "Settings". </li>
</ul>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/6-10.png" /> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Scroll down the page and see the coveted proposal to delete the page. Click on it. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7-10.png" /> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> The window that appears shows the reasons why the user wants to delete the account. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/8-10.png" /> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Select the option "My page is not being commented on" by placing a marker there. And voila - a text will automatically appear in the message field, where those who are interested in your page will be mentioned. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/9-10.png" /> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Next, the page can be closed. However, if your curiosity is not satisfied, no one forbids you to try again. Click "Cancel" and repeat all over again. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/10-30.png" /> </p>
<ul>
  <li> The secret is that the names change on different attempts. </li>
</ul>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11-29.png" /> </p>
<blockquote><p> <strong> Important: </strong> if your hand trembled and instead of “Cancel” you accidentally clicked on “Delete”, do not worry, because you can restore the page in VK immediately and in a couple of seconds. It's even easier than deleting a VKontakte audio recording. </p> </blockquote>
<h2> My Guests Application Features </h2>
<p> The social network Vkontakte has a sea of ​​applications that lure users with the opportunity to watch guests. The most popular service is "My Guests". Let's discuss how to work with it: </p>

</ul>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/15-25.png" /> </p>
<blockquote><p> <strong> Important: </strong> At the top of the guest list, you are likely to see unfamiliar names and avatars marked with a blue heart. Do not rush to go to the pages of these people, since they were not interested in you, this application automatically adds them to the guest list in order to promote other people's accounts, creating an intrigue. </p> </blockquote>
<p> The My Guests application has the following features today: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> <strong> "Guests" tab </strong> - allows you to know the guests of the page; </li>
  <li> <strong> "Fans" tab </strong> - helps to get information about the fans of your page. These are the ones who performed the most various actions on it, for example, shared your posts, liked and actively left comments. </li>
  <li> <strong> "Promotion" tab </strong> - designed to increase the popularity of the page. As a rule, this service is useful for representatives of show business, bloggers, writers, entrepreneurs, as well as people seeking to find new acquaintances or promote a VK group. Promotion is a paid option. </li>
  <li> <strong> Tab "Photo display" </strong> - will please those wishing to see and rate other people's photos or demonstrate their own (on a paid basis). </li>

</ul>
</p>

</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/20-22.png" /> </p>

<h2> VK statistics as a way to find out about visitors </h2>
<p> VK statistics contains information about network users who visited your page or viewed news and photos. <strong> This option is available only to those who are the happy owner of more than a hundred subscribers </strong>. To go to it, you need to click on the icon with a diagram located under the avatar. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23-20.png" /> </p>
<p> VKontakte statistics presents information on three tabs - "Reach", "Attendance" and "Activity". On the Reach tab, you will see a graph showing the number of users (subscribers and “outsiders”) who viewed your posts on the wall or in the News section. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/24-19.png" /> </p>
<p> If you scroll down the page a little, you will see a chart showing the gender and age of the guests on your page. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/25-19.png" /> </p>
<p> Below is information regarding the geography of profile visitors. Most often, it is she who is of particular interest: for example, knowing about the presence of a friend in Kostroma and seeing this city on the list, you will understand that a friend came to you. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/26-18.png" /> </p>
<p> The "Attendance" tab contains data on the number of unique visitors and views. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://konekto.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/27-15.png" /> </p>
<p> Thus, VK statistics will help you get a general idea of ​​how interesting your page is to visitors and how often they visit you. The main feature is the ability to track the geography of visitors. </p>
<h2> Should you use guest tracking software? </h2>
<p> At the moment, there are no programs to find out about the guests of the page. The VKontakte policy does not provide for such an opportunity, as it is aimed at maintaining confidentiality. In the functionality of the social network, there is no magic button that reveals all the secrets. If you enter the search query into the search engine, then, of course, you will see many sites offering programs for tracking VK visitors. However, curiosity will most likely have to pay dearly - the likelihood that your personal data will be extracted and your account banally hacked is huge. </p>
<p> There is another option - during the installation of the "secret" program, you will need to pay or send a message. As a result, money and time will sink into oblivion, but you still won't get any sense, since there are no miracles: there are no programs for fixing guests. Although something new may appear on your computer - a virus. But such a prospect is unlikely to please, so it is better not to play detectives. </p>
<h2> Summing it up </h2>
<p> The easiest and most informative way to find out who comes to your VK is based on deleting the page. Likes and comments, of course, will also illustrate the visitors, however, even before their analysis, there seemed to be no secret. The My Guests app is a great way to see your visitors by date, but keep in mind that only those who have done anything that affect you are displayed. </p>

<h3> Paid version of the My Guests app </h3>
<p> The "Promotion" tab is intended for those who wish to use the paid version of the application. The principle of operation here is quite simple.

<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://vkbaron.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/gosti-7.jpg" /> </p>
<p> Beginners SMM-masters prefer to use ready-made packages of paid services. To do this, you need to open the "Ready packages" tab, click on the best option and click the "Buy" button. Payment is made using Votes - the internal currency of VK. </p>
<h3> Configuring the paid version of the My Guests app </h3>

<p> To do this, in the "Manual settings" tab you need to register data for each item. </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Design. Select the information that will be indicated next to your profile avatar. </li>
  <li> Promotion object. You can promote your own profile or the page of any of your friends. </li>
  <li> Target audience. Write down gender, age, city of residence of users who will see ads. </li>
  <li> Cost. Specify the number of votes that will be spent on the advertising campaign. The number of impressions will be determined automatically. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> All that remains is to launch the application and monitor the results of its work. </p>

<h2>Отзывы о приложениях-шпионах ВКонтакте</h2>
<p>Пользователи ВКонтакте оставляют множественные отзывы о работе приложения «Мои гости». Среди них как восторженные комментарии, так и критика программы. Чаще всего звучат жалобы, что приложение отражает информацию только о тех юзерах, кто оставил на странице какой-либо «след» — лайк, репост, комментарий. А простых посетителей оно попросту не видит. Другие отмечают, что приложение часто подвергается блокировке со стороны технической службы ВКонтакте. Правда или нет — эти замечания, неизвестно. Выяснить это можно лишь через личный опыт общения с программой. Впрочем, немало и тех, кто активно использует «Мои гости» в целях продвижения коммерческих продуктов в социальной сети.
