<h1> Screw oil press for cold pressing. </h1>
<p> There are many products in the kitchen that we use for cooking. For example, vegetable oil. But few people think about how such a simple, seemingly, and constantly used product gets into the kitchen. There is special equipment for squeezing oil from various seeds, it is called an oil press. </p>
<p> There are several ways to obtain vegetable oil from seeds. It doesn't matter which seeds you use, but the principle for all three methods is almost the same, with the exception of some nuances. So: </p>
<p> - method number 1 - extraction, this method uses toxic substances, of course such oil goes through many stages of purification. But in the end, it is not possible to get rid of harmful impurities by 100%, but the percentage of squeezed oil approaches the maximum mark; </p>
<p> - method number 2 - cold pressing with advance preparation. With this method, the seeds first undergo moisture-heat treatment, and then are squeezed. Thus, they achieve almost 50% of the squeezed amount of oil; </p>
<p> - method number 3 - cold pressing, at low temperatures. This is honestly the best and most natural way to get oil. For such extraction, a screw oil press for cold extraction is used. </p>
<p> We can conclude that with method number 3, the output we get is the cleanest and most useful product, I would like to add a few words about it. </p>
<p> It is not difficult to guess that with this method, the amount of squeezed oil is much less than with others, it approaches 25%. But such oil is not processed, neither by temperature, let alone by chemicals. </p>
<p> The price of a screw oil press may vary depending on its purpose and model. If you decide to launch your own production, then you should take a closer look at its technical characteristics. And most likely, you will have to buy an oil press for primary oil extraction and secondary, in this step-by-step way you will be able to save on raw materials. Industrial oil presses are designed to work with large volumes of seeds. It is very important that it be more powerful and durable, of course the raw material itself, which you will process, plays an important role. In this way, maximum productivity can be achieved. The final price of a cold-pressed screw oil press will depend on the configuration. </p>
<p> PJSC "Kuvandyk plant KPO" Dolina "produces a screw press model DO 928 for squeezing oil from unbroken sunflower seeds and other oil crops according to the scheme of single, double or triple pressing according to cold pressing technology. </p>

<h1> Home Oil Press </h1>
<p> Ecology of consumption. Life hack: Build several different types of installations and open a home oil refinery mini-factory. </p>
<p> To obtain oil industrially, seeds are poured with gasoline fractions. Hexane, for example. When oil is formed from the seeds, this hexane is removed with steam, and its residues are removed with alkali. At the exit, various undesirable substances arise in the finished product: resins and pigments. Solvent residues rarely evaporate completely. </p>
<p> Before the oil obtained by the extraction method can be eaten or used in medicine, it needs to go through several more stages of purification: refining, then hydration, then bleaching, then deodorization, and finally a couple more filtration steps. </p>
<p> On hearing the phrase about oils that go through 7 stages of purification. It's true! Extraction oil can be infinitely refined, filtered, purified, filtered - to get rid of traces of chemical gasoline components. </p>

<p> A product without the slightest signs of life: without a single color and with a complete absence of any smell. The resulting slurry is bottled, and on all labels they proudly write "butter", misleading all buyers, as if this is the case. </p>
<p> Interestingly, in Russian supermarkets, for example, more of this refined oil is sold per year than the amount of all seeds grown in Russia and the CIS! How is this possible? With the help of cheap palm oil, which is used to dilute the already deodorized, refined and processed oils by all possible chemical methods. </p>
<p> <strong> Now it's clear why vegetable oil is HARMFUL? </strong> </p>
<p> Because it is impossible, even with the longest and highest-quality processing, to remove the residues of chemicals and gasoline from it - they will certainly be present in the finished product. In addition, refined oil that has undergone heat treatment and exposure to chemicals, unlike natural oil, has a very low content of vitamins, proteins, phosphatides, chlorophyll and carotene. Its composition is saturated with fats and is very different from what was originally "intended" by nature. </p>
<p> And then we eat it! We fry dishes in oil with gasoline! But few people know that at high temperatures chemical reactions take place in it, as a result of which new, extremely toxic compounds are formed. Therefore, the oil should never be heated above 150 degrees or reused! And in a frying pan, it reaches a temperature of as much as 250 degrees. </p>
<p> Throughout our lives, we, without thinking at all, use this supertoxic miracle in food, and even with gasoline, and then we are surprised at our unexpected diseases and poor health. We are outraged that people already at an early age develop cancer and age faster than before ... </p>
<p> <strong> What to do? </strong> </p>
<p> And you need to do your own oil press, since there is nothing complicated here. </p>
<p> The mini oil press ensures the production of quality oil that lasts for 1-2 years. It can produce oil from sunflower, rice, hemp, flax, pumpkin seeds, watermelon, melon, and nuts. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://econet.ru/uploads/pictures/171442/content_44__econet_en.jpg" /> <br /> There used to be mechanical presses in hardware stores to press grape or apple juice, some of them provided pressure up to 12 atmospheres. Adjusting them to the oil pressure is very simple: you just need to replace the clip with a more powerful one. </p>
<p> If you failed to purchase such a press, then it can be made from scrap materials. The design provides for ground pressure by means of a worm screw. The force of pressure depends on the capacity of the uprights of the beam, as well as the diameter of the worm nut. Therefore, it is better to make a beam with a large margin of power, that is, thickness and width, made of hard wood, or find a metal one. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://econet.ru/uploads/pictures/171430/content_4__econet_en.jpg" /> </p>
<p> The design contains a cylinder without a bottom. It can be made anew or made from a part of a keg, preferably a new one with a straight rivet, reinforced at the bottom with another hoop. The press wheel is made of hard wood: oak, beech, ash, acacia. The material must be dry. It is desirable to make all other wooden parts of the structure from the same material. If you use metal (pallet, hoops, flange), then it is advisable to use stainless steel or bronze. </p>
<p> At oil crushing plants, peeling and crushing operations are performed separately. Here we managed to combine them in one design, which is easy to make. </p>

<p> Roughing rolls are two exchangeable rollers that rotate using gears mounted on metal risers, to which the upper and lower buckets, a rocker arm or a swing arm are also attached. All these parts can be made or picked up from scrap metal. Replaceable wooden rollers, covered with a cloth grater (depending on the width, one or two graters are needed per roller, on which potatoes are chopped into starch, or potato pancakes). </p>
<p> The process of the installation is as follows: when the seeds poured into the bucket are peeled off, gear 2 rotates from the working gear 3, and from them the upper roller, sheathed with a grater cloth, rotates. Attached with a lever and a spring to the working gear 3, the toggle gear 1, which engages with it and rotates another roller (lower), sheathed with a float. The direction of its movement is rotational. The seeds that are fed into the gap between the rollers are peeled off. Kernels and husks fall into the lower bucket. </p>
<p> This mixture is collected, winnowed and, replacing the rollers with smooth ones, is poured back into the upper bucket. Now for rolling. But in order for the structure to shift the mass, the lever must be moved to position B, in order to disengage gear 1, which will now rotate freely in the same direction as gear 2, compressing and squeezing the core. The rolled mass in the form of a slurry is used for pressing and squeezing out oil. </p>
<p> Both the peeling rollers and the press work in isolation. The products come out clean, of high quality, tasty, especially when the kernel is well fried. For this, frankly, experience is needed (all this is achieved experimentally). The output of products is slightly lower than at specialized enterprises. It is understandable, the pressure is not right. But this, as they say, is not so bad. </p>

<p> Insufficiently squeezed cake (cake), if the kernel has been well cleaned, can be successfully used for making sweets, cookies and other sweets. </p>
<p> And the oil comes out of high quality. In addition, it is possible to mechanize these installations, supply electric motors. Build several different types of plants and open a home oil refinery, etc. </p>
<p> It all depends on your ingenuity. published by econet.ru </p>
