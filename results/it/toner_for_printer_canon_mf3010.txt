<p> 4. We assemble the mining hopper in the reverse order, install the squeegee in place by screwing it with two bolts (it is advisable not to clean the rubber part of the squeegee, this is done so that there are no snacks and further damage to the squeegee), clean the corotron and put the drum in place with a dry cloth, Figure 8. </p>

<p> 15. Refueling is complete, you can insert the cartridge into the printer and print. It is possible to print on the first 5 sheets with defects, but they should go away. As a result, the print should be clear, without dots and stripes. </p>

<ul>
  <li> There is a chip on this model, but it does not block, it is very rare to block Wi-Fi or the scanner's automatic feeder (if you have one) when using a refilled cartridge. </li>
  <li> For any cartridge, after the first refueling, the original photo roll noticeably begins to print faintly over the entire sheet area, it is advisable to change it at the first refueling, after several refills this is a prerequisite (for non-original photo drums, for example: which our online store sells, the drum can print 3 -5 refills without pallor and defects if used correctly). </li>
