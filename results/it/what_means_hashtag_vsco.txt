<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://www.syl.ru/misc/i/ai/301783/1678971.jpg" /> </p>
<h2> Secrets of popularity </h2>
<p> When publishing pictures, the application automatically adds its own postscripts: #VSCOcam and, in fact, #VSCO. What does this signature mean on Instagram? At least that your post will be seen by thousands of people, because these are some of the most popular hashtags at the moment. Let's talk about one more little trick. If you think a particular shot is better than others, you can add the hashtags #VSCOgood and #VSCOgrid to your caption. They will help you get even more likes on really worthwhile posts. </p>
<h2> Key Features </h2>
<p> Let's talk about why thousands of users around the world use VSCO. What can this application do? </p>
<p> <ol>
  <li> Like Instagram, you can post a photo. However, unlike the popular social network, there are no likes and comments - only pure art. </li>
  <li> Shop with gorgeous filter collections. Most of them are paid, but they cost 100% of their money. After processing, the pictures look like they were taken by a professional photographer. The cost of the sets is from $ 1 to $ 3. </p> </ol>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://www.syl.ru/misc/i/ai/301783/1678976.jpg" /> </p>
<p> All this is packaged in a minimalistic interface with simple typography and a strict grid. The application has gained popularity among both amateur and professional photographers. The editor is currently available for free download in the Play Market and iTunes. </p>
<h2> Interface and Features </h2>
<p> After launching the application, you will see several tabs: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Profile (profile); </li>
  <li> Library; </li>
  <li> Explore (gallery of publications); </li>
  <li> Shop (filter shop). </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://www.syl.ru/misc/i/ai/301783/1678977.jpg" /> </p>
<p> Let's talk more about working in the application. On startup, you find yourself in the library. All photos that were taken and edited using the application are displayed here. One of the innovations is a special tab where you can add your favorite images. You can move to other sections by swiping to the right. To see the work of other photographers, open the Explore tab. Like Instagram, you can follow interesting profiles. </p>
<p> Another section is Profile, your personal page in the VSCO community. What is it? First of all, it is a place where you can post your photos, create albums or share collections of your favorites. By the way, this is another important difference from Instagram - you can combine images into thematic collections (albums). </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://www.syl.ru/misc/i/ai/301783/1678978.jpg" /> </p>
<p> Let's look at the camera mode. For shooting, the app has a number of settings: you can turn the flash on or off, switch between standard and square formats, change the white balance, etc. In the version for iOS 8 and above, you can also adjust the ISO white balance and shutter speed. </p>
<p> Well, the most interesting thing is, of course, the editor itself. You can immediately change the photo you just took or upload any image from the gallery. All basic settings are available on the panel below: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> adjust brightness and contrast; </li>
  <li> temperature (more warm or cold tones); </li>
  <li> rotate and align the photo; </li>
  <li> cropping; </li>
  <li> vignetting; </li>
  <li> adding filters, etc. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> Note that the filter intensity can be adjusted in 12 steps. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://www.syl.ru/misc/i/ai/301783/1678987.jpg" /> </p>
<p> The most interesting thing about VSCO is that this application, even with minimal processing, allows you to get truly spectacular and atmospheric photos. That is why it is so popular among famous photobloggers. </p>
<h2> Is there a desktop version of VSCO? </h2>
<p> Yes, you can also download the Windows app from the official website. Almost all versions of the operating system are supported - XP, 7, 8 and 10. The functionality of VSCO for a computer is completely identical to that of applications for smartphones. The same features, the same minimalist design that makes photo editing a pleasure. </p>
<h2> Can I get all the filters for free? </h2>
<p> Due to the crazy popularity of the application, many sites have appeared on the Web offering to buy or download a hacked version of VSCO with unlocked paid presets. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://www.syl.ru/misc/i/ai/301783/1678984.jpg" /> </p>
<p> However, fans of "freebies" should be more careful, because often in addition to "cracked" programs are viruses and malware. In addition, the program itself may work with errors, and it will not be possible to update it. Therefore, in this case, it is better not to be greedy, but, if possible, buy those sets that you really like. </p>
