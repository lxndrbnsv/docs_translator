<p> It's no secret that in many homes the TV is used simply to create a sound background during the day. Especially for such subscribers, there is a service from Tricolor TV - Radio package. With its help, you can listen to up to 35 popular radio stations in excellent quality through your TV set. The soundtrack of video content periodically makes you look at the screen, which distracts you from business. With the radio, such problems usually do not arise, which is very convenient. We will tell you who can activate this service and what are the features of its use. </p>
<h2> Some details </h2>
<p> Tricolor TV presented the "Radio" package in 2013. At that time, the choice of radio stations was small, but quite sufficient. Along with the standard Mayak and Vesti FM, it was possible to listen to Russian and Dorozhnoe radio, Europe + and about 20 different stations. </p>
<p> The package connection was available to everyone. The subscription fee for it was charged separately and on average was equal to the cost of most packages of television channels. But soon the company found this service unprofitable and wrote it off to the archive. However, Tricolor did not completely abandon the idea of ​​broadcasting through TV. <br /> </p>

<h3> Who can listen to the radio today </h3>
<p> From 2015 to the present day, Tricolor radio has been a free application for TV broadcasting services for subscribers. It is included by default in packages such as: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Single; </li>
  <li> Single Multi; </li>
  <li> United Multi Lite; </li>
  <li> Unified Ultra HD; </li>
  <li> Extra. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<blockquote> <p> Important! It is impossible to connect to radio broadcasting without one of these packages. </p> </blockquote>
<h3> Technical requirements </h3>
<p> Radio broadcasting via satellite is not yet available to all residents of the Russian Federation, but only to Tricolor subscribers from central Russia. The service is provided in the coverage area of ​​Eutelsat W4 and W7 satellites. The company's clients who are not within the range of these satellites, even if the above packages are connected, will not be able to use it. </p>

<p> In addition to the place of residence, one more requirement is presented to radio lovers - the presence of a modern receiver. Broadcasting is done in MPEG4 format, therefore, the set-top box must support this format. The earliest receiver models do not accept this type of broadcasting at all. Set-top boxes 2-3 years old can only play a few channels. To use the service in full, it is worth clarifying the compatibility of the equipment and the radio package. This can be done on the website of the satellite operator or in its technical support service. </p>
<blockquote> <p> Important! No other special devices are required. There is no need to purchase a radio remote control for Tricolor TV - it does not belong to the radio service at all, but only makes it possible to control the TV, being away from it, for example, in the next room or on another floor. </p> </blockquote>
<h2> Possible problems </h2>
<p> At the beginning of using radio from Tricolor, subscribers often encounter some difficulties. Let's take a look at the most common ones. <br /> </p>
<h3> Missing of some stations </h3>
<p> Many clients, wishing to receive radio broadcasting services, exchange receivers of old models for new ones with a surcharge. But often even after replacing the radio remains inaccessible or makes it possible to listen to only 3-4 stations. This problem is completely solvable - you just need to set up a new receiver. To do this: </p>
<p> We described each of these stages in detail on our website. </p>
<blockquote> <p> Important! This algorithm of actions can also help in the event that some of the radio stations suddenly disappeared on the old receiver. This can happen due to a software crash or loss of hardware activation if it has been idle for too long. </p> </blockquote>
<h3> How to leave the radio in Tricolor </h3>
<p> To switch between the TV and radio broadcasting modes, use the "Radio" and "TV" buttons. Everything seems to be simple and intuitive. But one feature should be taken into account: the transition between modes can be made only from the menu for selecting channels or selecting satellites. This explains most of the difficulties of novice subscribers with how to switch from radio to TV Tricolor. Even rebooting the set-top box does not help to get rid of radio broadcasting! </p>

<p> Read: what are the pros and cons of a game console from Tricolor. </p>
<p> In order not to go to the channel list every time, it is worth making some settings on the receiver. To do this: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> go to the main menu of the equipment; </li>
  <li> select the "System" section; </li>
  <li> go to the subsection "User Interface"; </li>
  <li> find the item "Hide channel list in radio mode"; </li>
  <li> set the found item to "No". </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://otrikolortv.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/radio.jpg" /> </p>
<p> After making these settings, you can exit the radio mode by simply pressing the Exit key on the remote control. </p>
<blockquote> <p> Important! The given setup instructions may not be relevant for some receiver models. In particular, the names of the menu sections may differ from those indicated. </p> </blockquote>
<h3> No central stations </h3>
<p> As you know, for television broadcasting, a list of television channels is legally established, which should always be available, regardless of subscription fees. However, there is no such law for radio. Therefore, even federal stations, such as Mayak or Radio Russia, will be turned off if the subscription fee is not paid in time for using the package of channels to which they are attached. </p>
<blockquote> <p> Important! As a result of technical failures, commercial radio stations usually disappear. Loss of broadcasting from federal frequencies usually indicates the end of the subscription period. </p> </blockquote>
<p> You can check the subscription validity on the main page of the Tricolor website. There is a button “Check subscriptions” on it under the advertising banners. By clicking it, the subscriber gets into a small form where he will need to enter the equipment ID and verification code. If a search reveals that your subscription is expired, you must pay for it. Otherwise, resetting the receiver settings to the factory level will help. <br /> </p>

<h2> Internet radio access </h2>
<p> In the first years of the service's existence, subscribers of Tricolor TV radio could listen to online broadcasts of the channels included in the package. At the moment, unfortunately, this service is not officially supported. Although there are a couple of sites on the network claiming that they broadcast Tricolorovsky radio, in fact they do not belong to this operator. <br /> <iframe src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/gt9IiXq6CF4?feature=oembed"> </iframe> </p>

<h1> If the radio is playing on the console instead of the TV image </h1>
<p> Quite a widespread appeal from users when one day the digital set-top box switches to radio mode and stops showing TV channels. Changing channels does not help, only radio stations change. The fact is that in addition to 20 television channels, three radio stations are broadcast in the digital stream. Listening to radio on TV is a dubious undertaking, all the more so because the inclusion of radio stations in the first multiplex insignificantly affects the image quality on TV channels. But RTRS decided that we still need radio on TV and it is there. </p>
<h2> How to switch from radio mode to TV mode </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "http://www.satx.ru/tvradio.jpg" /> </p>
<p> All digital receivers, without exception, have a button for switching from radio mode to TV viewing mode and back. Usually this button is called TV / RADIO, less often TV / R or just RADIO. It is with its help that you and with can return back to watching TV channels. In TV mode, the button switches to radio mode, if the set-top box is in radio listening mode, the same button will return you to TV viewing mode. </p>
<p> If you are installing a prefix, for example, for parents, then we advise you to immediately find this button on the remote control and show it in action. As a rule, the button is pressed accidentally and the elderly do not understand what happened. Manipulation of settings, switching wires, etc. often begins. which further exacerbates the situation. </p>
