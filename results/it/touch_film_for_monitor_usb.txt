<p> Touch tapes from 2 to 100 simultaneous touches. Sizes from 30 to 100 inches. Ultra transparent, 5ms response time! </p>
<p> One or two touch touch tapes. There is also a rear-projection version of the touch screen film for interactive showcases! </p>
<p> CRASIIS actively uses innovative multitouch technologies and develops relevant ideas to help bring the most complex ideas to life. In our work we actively use the latest material - interactive film. </p>
<p> When combining such a film and a monitor with another multitouch material, there is a unique opportunity to create objects of various shapes, parameters and designs. A key feature of interactive film is that it allows you to create a touchscreen from any non-conductive surface. In other words, with its help, you can use any design thing as an information board or advertising field. </p>
<h2> Key features of the material </h2>
<p> The sensor film is characterized by a minimum thickness, and it is also practically invisible during application. The principle of operation of this layer is based on the use of microscopic nanowires, which are distinguished by a high response speed, significantly exceeding the material developed for the iPhone in this parameter. In addition, the offered capacitive film: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> does not change over time; </li>
  <li> resistant to water; </li>
  <li> does not change when exposed to UV rays. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2> Benefits of collaboration </h2>
<p> CRASIIS offers high-quality interactive film with various characteristics and sizes. Our experience and knowledge is enough to bring the most daring ideas to life. Please note that there are special discounts for regular customers. </p>
<p> You can get more detailed information, as well as purchase a film, by calling the sales department managers at +7 (495) 722-34-00 or by leaving a request for a call back. </p>

<h1> Sensor foil </h1>
<p> <strong> Sensor foil </strong> (interactive or) - electronic foil with a network of sensors located on the inside of the glazing, so that the foil reacts to any touch, like any touch screen, for example, a tablet computer screen. </ p>
<p> Interactive are used in a variety of industries in the advertising and information sphere. Interactive film is an excellent tool for upgrading existing display systems. The film is glued to a showcase, window, or rear projection screen. Using the touch film, you can control the system, search for information, make notes, make notes, corrections, etc. without additional devices, using your fingers. </p>
<h2> Types and principle of operation </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "http://inter-systems.ru/upload/image/tach.jpg" /> Interactive films are produced in two types: rear-projection sensor film and transparent interactive film. </p>
<p> Transparent touch film is glued to any monitor, turning it into a touch screen. The principle of operation of a transparent touch film is based on interactive interaction that occurs when you touch the surface from the outside, while the monitor, display or screen itself is located inside the room or the body of the device. </p>
<p> This type of interactive film is widely used in cash registers, as well as payment and information terminals located on the streets, shops, train stations, airports, supermarkets, hotels </p>
<p> The rear projection sensor film is mounted on glass or a backlit screen (light enhancing screen). Rear-projection interactive film is used in conjunction with a multimedia projector to create a rear-projection touch screen. </p>
<p> Used when creating interactive showcases, when conducting presentations, trainings, lectures, exhibitions, press conferences, in museums, </p>
