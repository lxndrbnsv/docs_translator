<h1> Online Binary Calculator </h1>
<p> This calculator can perform the following operations on binary numbers: </p>
<h2> Binary addition </h2>
<p> The addition of two binary numbers is performed in a column bitwise. Starting with the least significant digit (right to left), as with column addition of decimal numbers. But since there are only two digits (0 and 1), their addition occurs according to the following rules: </p>
<h3> Example </h3>
<p> For example, add 1011 and 101: </p>
<p> <table> <tr> <td rowspan = "2"> <b> + </b> </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 < / td> <td> 1 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 </td> </tr> <tr> < td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 0 </td> </tr> </table> </ p >
<h2> Subtract binary numbers </h2>
<p> Subtraction of binary numbers is performed similarly to addition - column, but according to the following rules: </p>
<h3> Example </h3>
<p> For example, subtract 101 from 1011: </p>
<p> <table> <tr> <td rowspan = "2"> <b> - </b> </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 < / td> <td> 1 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 </td> </tr> <tr> < td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> </tr> </table> </p>
<h2> Binary multiplication </h2>
<p> Multiplication of binary numbers is performed in a column similar to multiplication in decimal system, but according to the following rules: </p>
<h3> Example </h3>
<p> For example, let's multiply numbers 1011 and 101: </p>
<p> <table> <tr> <td rowspan = "2"> <b> Ã— </b> </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 < / td> <td> 1 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 </td> </tr> <tr> < td rowspan = "3"> <b> + </b> </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </ td > </tr> <tr> <td> 0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 0 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> </tr> <tr> <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> </tr> </table> </p>
<h2> Division of binary numbers </h2>
<p> Externally, the division of binary numbers is similar to the division of decimal numbers, but there are some nuances: such division is performed by subtracting the divisor with a shift to the right if the remainder is greater than zero. To understand this process, consider an example: </p>

<p> <strong> How to use this calculator: </strong> The calculator has two input fields for entering binary numbers. The first field is for the first number, the second, respectively, for the second. </p>
<p> Between these two fields, you need to choose what mathematical action you want to perform on them. You can add and subtract, as well as multiply or divide binary fractional numbers. </p>
<p> You can use a period or comma to enter a binary fractional number. After entering numbers and choosing a mathematical operation on them, click the calculate button. And at the top of the page information will appear with the calculation result. </p>

<h1> Addition of number systems </h1>
<p> <b> To add two numbers in different or the same number systems, enter natural numbers and fill in the base of the number systems, also choose which number system to display the result in. </b> </p>
