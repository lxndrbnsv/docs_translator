<p> Nobody forces you to use. But you cannot force everyone to stop using this borrowing. why reinvent the wheel! A wonderful word "light recording", change it for some chopped off "photo"? What a thrill we need all these overseas words! </p>

<p> I agree, our Russian language is rich and there is no need to use overseas, the word "photo-portrait" is enough, because everyone understands it ?! </p>

<p> Do you want to say your words in Russian? </p>
<p> 1. The word "photo"? <br /> The Greek word for "light" </p>
<p> 2. The word "auto"? <br /> The Greek word for "myself" </p>
<p> 3. The word "portrait"? <br /> French word with indistinct translation: "to reproduce something like hell." </p>
<p> You are just subject to your old beliefs, not accepting anything new people. If everyone were like you, then instead of “selfies” we would have “light recording of yourself”. </p>

<p> I thought it was a self-portrait in Russian, but it turns out it's some kind of "selfie" - sorry, but in my mind this word smells like foreign shit. </p>

<p> I believe that these are our young people who are highly advanced, but over time they forget about their culture and their native Russian language, drumming for the Americans, <br /> Columbus discovered America, that's the whole story, and what's next, emptiness ... ... …… .. </p>
<p> alex65ava1, I see you have a very deep knowledge of American history ... You would read at least Wikipedia at your leisure, so that next time you don't look like an ignoramus. </p>

<p> The Russian language has a unique theme. that he knows how to keep in himself only the words we really need. all. which is rubbish. goes away with time. don't worry, and these selfies and gifs will eventually go away as unnecessary. All languages ​​are enriched by borrowing words from other languages. The more illiterate a person is, the more he uses other people's words in his speech. Love your native language. now there is no language equal to it in the world. beauty and expressiveness. I have worked more than fifty years with the English language, and know three more foreign languages…. </p>

<p> For some reason, the Americans do not say "author's photo". <br /> Well, if English is prettier to you than Russian, then you need to completely switch to English, and not distort the language of our ancestors. The language of Pushkin, Lermontov. Tolstoy…. You look funny when you speak with jumbled words. </p>

<p> Rafael-24.02.2016 09 00 Bravo! You noticed perfectly well that unnecessary words will go away on their own. Nowadays young people mostly read little literature, the main thing is the Internet, and there is only foreign language, so they picked up and flaunt it, not knowing their native Russian language. </p>

<p> <b> Selfie </b> (English selfie, from "self" - himself, himself; Russian equivalents - "<b> selfies </b>", "<b> samostrel </b>" - considered vernacular [1]) - a kind of self-portrait, created with a camera, sometimes with a mirror, monopod or self-timer. The term gained popularity in the late 2000s and early 2010s due to the development of built-in camera functions in mobile devices. Since selfies are most often taken from the distance of an outstretched hand holding the camera, the image in the photo has a characteristic foreshortening and composition - at an angle, just above or below the head [2]. </p>

<p> The first ever distinct photographic portrait of a person is also the first self-portrait. This photograph was taken by the American chemist Robert Cornelius in 1839 [3]. </p>
<p> Photographic self-portraits have existed in a less common form around the time the Kodak <i> Kodak Brownie </i> portable camera was introduced (1900). The method, as a rule, was based on photographing one's own reflection in a mirror, the camera was fixed with a tripod, looking through the viewfinder the photographer framed the future picture. Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna, at the age of 13, was one of the first teenagers to take a photograph of her own with a mirror to send to a friend in 1914. In the letter that accompanied the photograph, she wrote: “I made this picture while looking in the mirror. It was very difficult as my hands were shaking. ”</p>
<p> The earliest written use of the word <i><b>selfie</b> </i> found by the compilers of the Oxford English Dictionary was in a September 13, 2002 post on the Australian Internet Forum at ABC. [4] [5] The author of the post said that it was a common slang word back then. In addition, words with the -ie suffix are generally popular in Australia. [6] </p>
<h3> Popularity [edit | edit code] </h3>
<p> The term <i> selfie </i> was discussed by photographer Jim Krause in 2005, although selfies were taken much earlier. In the early 2000s, before Facebook became the dominant social network, snapshots were widespread on MySpace. However, writer Keith Loss says that between 2006 and 2009 (when Facebook became more popular than MySpace), selfies began to carry a reputation for bad taste for users of the new social network Facebook, as it was considered a holdover from the less popular social network MySpace (then the selfie was called "MySpace pic"). In contrast, early Facebook avatars tended to be well-focused and more formal, and were captured from a distance. Improvements in design, especially the front camera of American, Korean and Japanese mobile phones and mobile photography applications such as Instagram, led to a resurgence of selfies in the early 2010s. </p>
<p> Initially popular among young people, selfies have become popular among adults, in particular - Pope Francis uploads selfies to his 60 million Internet audience, in which he is captured with visitors to the Vatican [7] [8]. In December 2012, Time magazine noted that the word “selfie” was included in the 2012 “Top 10 Buzzwords”. Although the selfie has existed for many years, it was in 2012 that the term really became a hit of the new era. According to a 2013 survey, two-thirds of Australian women aged 18-35 used the selfie method to post photos on Facebook. A study conducted among owners of smartphones and cameras revealed that about 30% of selfies were taken by people aged 18-24. </p>
<p> By 2013, the word “selfie” had become common enough to be included in the Oxford Online Dictionary of the English Language. In November 2013, the word "selfie" was announced as "word of the year" in the Oxford English Dictionary [9] [10], which is officially considered Australian in origin. </p>
<p> At the 86th Academy Awards, actress and ceremony host Ellen DeGeneres, along with actor Bradley Cooper, took a selfie in which they were captured in the company of many Hollywood stars. The photo broke the Twitter popularity record previously held by Michelle and Barack Obama, collecting over 3.2 million retweets per day [11]. </p>
<p> On June 11, 2014, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev posted his selfie on the Instagram social network, taken at the numerous requests of his subscribers [12]. Many selfies of 2014-2016 are the result of the participation of their authors in challenges [13]. </p>
<p> Since 2018 in Los Angeles (California, USA) there is a selfie museum [14] [15] [16] [17]. </p>

<p> In 2011, British naturalist photographer David Slater took a series of photographs of crested baboons while traveling in the jungle of Sulawesi. Unexpectedly for him, the monkeys took possession of the camera and were even able to take a number of pictures. The case received additional publicity due to a discussion about who owns the copyright for the images [18] [19]. </p>
<h3> In contemporary art [edit | edit code] </h3>
<p> In 2013, artist Patrick Specchio, together with the New York Museum of Modern Art, presented an exhibition entitled “Art in Translation: Selfie, The 20/20 Experience”, in which viewers used a provided digital camera to take photos of themselves in a large mirror [20]. </p>

<h3> Risks to health and life [edit | edit code] </h3>
<p> In October 2014, Rospotrebnadzor warned about the possibility of the spread of head lice among adolescents due to excessive self-interest. The memo on the prevention of head lice, published by the Rospotrebnadzor administration in the Kursk region, says that joint filming of a group of adolescents or a couple contributes to the transmission of lice when their heads touch [2] [21]. </p>
<p> <i> “I've noticed a huge increase in head lice among teens this year. As a rule, I treat young children because they have a higher risk of head contact, but now adolescents cling their heads to each other every day to be photographed on a cell phone "</i>, - says Mary McQuillan, a head lice specialist from California. [21] . </p>
<p> In 2015, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in a special memo pointed out some of the risks of selfies, in which fans of extreme photos were reminded not to take such pictures with a weapon in their hands, on railway transport, on the roofs of buildings, bridges, and driving a car [22]. At the same time, Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported that there is no accurate police statistics on self-reported accidents [23]. In September 2015, Mashable reported 12 deaths in 2015 resulting from attempts to take selfies [24] [25]. </p>
<p> According to American scientists, from 2011 to 2017, more than 250 people died as a result of attempts to take an original selfie. Accidents most often occur in India, Russia, the USA and Pakistan. 72.5% of the dead are males. It is possible that the number of cases is much higher, since only those that were covered by the media were included in the report. The most common causes of death are traffic accidents, drowning and falls from a height. In addition, electric shocks, fires and animal attacks occur [26]. </p>
<h3> Religion [edit | edit code] </h3>
<p> Archpriest Pavel Velikanov urged Russian women not to tempt men with their selfies from Epiphany bathing. </p>
<blockquote> <p> I would like to urge any users of social networks to remember that if we give an answer for every idle word, then all the more we will give an answer for the wrong, embarrassing and seductive images that we publish on social networks. The Savior's Gospel clearly says: if your eye tempts you, it is better to pluck it out than to lose the Kingdom of God. So it doesn't really matter whether it will be an image of a woman in which she squeals into the icy water in a swimsuit, or it will be a photo in which a woman imposingly spreads herself on a deck chair under the rays of the scorching sun. Any seduction is a sin. </blockquote> </p>
<p> According to the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Muftis of Russia Rushan Abbyasov, photographing by pilgrims of themselves against the background of Islamic shrines in Mecca with the publication and discussion of these pictures on social networks cannot be approved if it distracts believers from the main thing - the correct performance of the Hajj [2]. </p>
<h3> Psychology [edit | edit code] </h3>
<p> There are psychological arguments against selfies. </p>
<h2> Relie [edit | edit code] </h2>
<p> A self-portrait with a loved one or a loved one was named by sociologists from Harvard University <i> relfie </i> (English relfie from <i> relationship selfie </i>) [28]. According to a study of 200 volunteers published in The Science of Relationships, relphies annoy subscribers on social media more than any other snapshot [28]. </p>
