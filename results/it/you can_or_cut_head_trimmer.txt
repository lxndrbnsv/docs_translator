<h1> The difference between a trimmer and a hair clipper </h1>
<p> A large assortment of barber devices is not only an advantage, but also a difficulty in choosing. Sometimes the future user has no idea, for example, how a trimmer differs from a hair clipper. This overview will help fill the information gap. </p>
<h2> What is each of the devices </h2>
<p> For hairdressing tasks at home, you can use a trimmer or hair clipper. However, each unit has its own mission. </p>
<p> The machine is ranked among the varieties of small household appliances. Its purpose is to <em> shorten the hair </em> on the head to a specified length. The latest models of devices make it possible to do such manipulations for a beard and mustache (this is more true for professional models). </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "http://tehnika.expert/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Manzone-Spa21.jpg" /> </p>
<p> A trimmer is, to a greater extent, after all, just a device that helps to <em> remove hair from any part of the body </em> (even in hard-to-reach places). Additional attachments are provided to allow you to use it as a razor. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "http://tehnika.expert/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Best-Beard.jpg" /> </p>
<p> For a more accurate understanding of the difference between these two types of techniques, it is worthwhile to make a detailed comparison of their capabilities. </p>
<h2> Comparison by key characteristics </h2>
<p> Monitoring of both devices will take into account the difference in: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> dimensions; </li>
  <li> weight; </li>
  <li> functions to be performed; </li>
  <li> comfort in use. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3> Size and weight </h3>
<p> <strong> The main difference between the two tools is noticeable from the first acquaintance: it lies in the small size and light weight of the trimmer </strong>. This "feature" was designed specifically so that you can take it with you on the road or just always have it at hand. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "http://tehnika.expert/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/3ed0218.jpeg" /> </p>
<p> Such a "trick" will not work with a typewriter - this unit is heavier and cumbersome, it will not fit into every bag. Its size is almost twice the trimmer. Of course, there are also compact options, but these are still not trimmer models. And, first of all, because of the functionality. </p>
<h3> What each device can do </h3>
<p> The rather large size of the machine is due to its impressive talents. This device is designed to <em> cut hair of any length. </em> To expand the possibilities, the device always comes with several blades and attachments. </p>
<p> But the trimmer will no longer cope with too long and coarse hair. The limitation of the pitch of 0.5-0.7 mm leaves an imprint in the work. However, the same condition grows into an advantage when it comes to sensitive surfaces. </p>
<p> There are models that are <em> designed for a beard, nose or mustache </em>. In universal devices for working with vegetation on different parts of the body, replaceable attachments are provided. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "http://tehnika.expert/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/4-v-1.jpg" /> </p>
<blockquote> <p> The head trimmer is mainly used for trimming the temporal hair or sideburns. </p> </blockquote>
<p> Special thanks should be paid to the inventors of such devices for their help in modeling haircuts, in particular, creating unusual patterns. For the same task, the unit is also used <em> in the intimate areas </em>, where, unambiguously, it will be painful and inconvenient to carry out such an operation with a machine. Thus, the technique can also perform the function of a razor. </p>
<h3> Ease of use </h3>
<p> This is a rather subjective factor, and what suits one may not suit another. But we will try to cover the main points. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <ol>
  <li> The trimmer makes <em> less noise </em> in operation. But the machine, although it makes noise (and even vibrates), has more power and is able to perform a high-quality haircut even on thick hair. </li>
  <li> A small device is easier to hold. On the other hand, car manufacturers are also trying to focus on the production of weight-friendly models. </li>
  <li> Machine heads should be lubricated constantly, otherwise they will simply twitch the hair. His younger "brother" only needs to rinse them in water. <br /> <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "http://tehnika.expert/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trimmer-dlia-strizhki.jpg" /> </li>
  <li> Cordless car models have a <em> charge lasts longer </em> than their opponent. But the device costs much more. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2> Which is better to choose </h2>
<p> Ideally, you should buy both. But when it comes to a specific choice, it is worth prioritizing. <strong> If you are planning to frequently cut thick and fast-growing hair, then it is best to get a clipper. </strong> </p>
<blockquote> <p> For model haircuts, you still need to get the appropriate knowledge, otherwise you will have to contact the hairdresser to refine the result. </p> </blockquote>
<p> For those people who like to be constantly groomed, it is advisable to buy a trimmer. This is especially true for the owners of today's fashionable <em> beards </em>. And for girls, special attachments will help maintain beauty in piquant places without going to a specialized salon, and at the same time develop their imagination in the barbarian art. </p>

<h1> How is a trimmer different from a hair clipper? </h1>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "http://mustang-professional.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chem-otlichaetsya-trimmer-ot-mashinki-dlya-strizhki.jpg" /> <br /> Just make a reservation - they are called trimmers many devices, including those not from the hairdressing sphere at all. To remove hair, two different types of trimmers are used - these are completely, fundamentally different tools. Visually, they simply cannot be confused, although the name is the same. </p>
<p> There are small household trimmers for removing hair from the nose and ears. We will not talk about them - this is simply not our area of ​​expertise. And there are large trimmers - devices that look similar to hair clippers, but noticeably different from them both in technical features and, accordingly, in functions. </p>
<p> We make these trimmers and are well versed in them. Therefore, we will talk about just such trimmers. </p>
<h4> Table of Contents: </h4>
<h2> The practical difference between trimmer and clipper - what do they do what? </h2>
<p> Yes, outwardly, trimmers and hair clippers are really similar - that is why many people have a question "how, in fact, do trimmers and clippers differ?" However, the practical difference between the two is huge. </p>
<p> A hair clipper is a tool that is actually used to reduce the length of hair in certain areas. And, thanks to this - to give the hair the desired shape. </p>
<p> A distinctive feature of the trimmer is the ability to cut hair almost at the root, up to tenths of a millimeter. In short, just a razor. </p>
<h3> Can I use a trimmer instead of a clipper and vice versa? </h3>
<p> And yes - both tools can <strong> try </strong> to perform the functions of another device. But it won't turn out very well. </p>
<p> The clipper, even with the attachments removed, will leave a noticeable part of the hair. For example, a Mustang Carbon car can leave a minimum of 0.6 millimeters - and this is still a good indicator. Making your hair even shorter, or even more so removing it completely with a machine, will not work. </p>
<p> The trimmer can be used to trim hair using the attachments. Moreover, when working with a beard, it is usually used, because the trimmer is more suitable for working with hard and thick hairs of the beard. However, if you try to do the same procedure with hair on your head, you will have a long and tedious job. You could do it much faster with a typewriter. </p>
<p> Therefore, clippers and trimmers do not replace each other, but complement. </p>
<h3> What is the use of the trimmer in tandem with the clipper? </h3>
<p> Firstly, as already mentioned, the scope of the trimmer is working with facial hair. It is best suited for both trimming beards and mustaches - and especially for shaping them. Because with a trimmer you can shave off the hair along the edges of the beard that doesn't fit your idea, but with a clipper you can't. </p>
<p> In addition, the trimmer is often used to work with the hair of the upper part of the head - but as an auxiliary tool for edging and performing some precise and filigree elements. </p>
<h2> How is a trimmer technically different from a hair clipper? </h2>
<p> Why is it like this? What technical differences between a trimmer and a clipper cause this difference in use - if an uninitiated in hairdressing may not even distinguish a trimmer from a clipper by eye? </p>
<h3> Knife position </h3>
<p> Firstly, this is the position of the knives, their proximity to the outer edge. It is because of this that the minimum cut height of hair in trimmers and clippers is so different - for example, 0.6 millimeters for a Mustang Carbon and 0.2 for a Mustang Carbon trimmer. </p>
<p> And it is thanks to this trimmer that you can shave off your hair almost at the very base. You can shave even cleaner, but this is only a razor. And the razor will still be more comfortable for you to work just after you have outlined the main lines with the trimmer. </p>
<h3> Working area width </h3>
<p> And this is the difference, thanks to which the trimmer is so convenient to do delicate work, for example, in edging - but it is inconvenient to work with the main volume of hair. </p>
<p> The working part of the trimmer is noticeably narrower than the working part of a conventional hair clipper. </p>
<h3> Motor and knives prepared for thick beard and mustache hair </h3>
<p> As you know, using hairdressing scissors for cutting hair is strongly discouraged from cutting a beard. Moreover, most hairdressers will tell you that if you cut your beard with your main scissors, then you have already ruined those scissors. </p>
<p> The same applies to car knives, albeit to a lesser extent. The hair of the beard and mustache is much stronger and thicker than the hair from the top of the head - and therefore the knives must have extra hard steel, and the motor must be especially powerful to deal with them time after time without degrading the cut quality. </p>
<p> Yes, cut quality is the key issue here. Because some hairdressers, learning about all this, say: "What do you mean, I cut my beard with my scissors - and nothing, they cut it, did not die." Cut, they cut. But you can't see what happens to the hair at the microscope level. And if you saw these broken, shattered sections, you would grab your head. </p>
<p> "So what?", the same hairdressers will answer, "I can't see them at the microscope level - and the client doesn't see either." True, he does not see. But he sees the result of this. Hair spoiled by an unsuccessful cut begins to split, becomes lifeless. </p>
<p> How long do you think it will take for your clients to realize that this unpleasant process is most active after they visit you? What do you think the client will do after realizing this? Of course - he will change the master. </p>
<p> And this process can become massive. And the customer base you carefully assembled, which gives you excellent and consistent income, will begin to fade. Pah-pah-pah, enough about this so as not to call. </p>
<p> But seriously, don't mix tools that cut the top of your head and your facial hair. In the long run, this can undermine your financial health. Clipper and separate scissors for the head, trimmer and separate scissors for the face. These are not unnecessary expenses, but a payback investment. </p>
<h2> Additional Mustang Professional Trims </h2>

</ul> </p>
<h4> Mustang Carbon MTB-01 Trimmer Red </h4>
<h4> Mustang Carbon MTB-01 Trimmer Blue </h4>
<h4> Trimmer Mustang Carbon MTB-01 Black </h4>
<p> In addition to the natural differences for trimmers, such as a reduced minimum cutting height, a narrow head and knives prepared for coarse hair, Mustang trimmers have some other special "tricks" that make them even more convenient to work with. </p>
<h3> Water Resistant </h3>
<p> Thanks to the water-resistant electrical components, Mustang Carbon trimmers can be cleaned with ease under the tap. Это очень удобно - намного проще чистить триммер между двумя клиентами, чем если каждый раз приходится снимать блок с ножами и мыть его отдельно.</p>
<h3>Долговечный мотор</h3>
<p>По сути, именно от срока работы этой части машинки или триммера зависит то, как долго вам будет служить весь инструмент. Мы в Mustang Professional хорошо понимаем это - и поэтому ставим в свои инструменты действительно достойные моторы производства Johnson Motors. Эта компания известна именно зашкаливающим сроком службы своих моторов.</p>
<h3>Пониженный шум и вибрация</h3>
<p>Дополнительное преимущество, которое делает вашу работу с триммерами Mustang Carbon еще более удобной. Низкая вибрация - работа триммера только ощущается, но никак не мешает четким движениям. Низкий шум - вы сами и ваши клиенты не чувствуете дискомфорта из-за громкого гудения. Поэтому вам приятнее работать, а клиентам приятнее часто к вам возвращаться.</p>
