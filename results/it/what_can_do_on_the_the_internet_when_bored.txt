<p> well, yes, boring <br /> welcome to the sites for <s> donkeys </s> who like to <s> jerk off </s> to play Tetris <br /> tag is boring to be more fun <br /> what to do play dice in the tunnels, <s> give pesds to commune </s> <br /> the mentality from the Middle Ages has not changed at all </p>
<p> "just now I was in the smoking room and my colleagues are discussing how they will go to drink beer after work. not read books" </p>
<p> I'm even afraid to ask - at what time did people discuss in the smoking room how they would go to read books? :)) </p>
<p> "was the most reading country in the world" </p>
<p> And then they took it and stopped, right? I don’t believe :) But I readily believe in the fact that there are fewer paper books in stores, and I am even sure of it. After all, statistics does not operate with other concepts. <br /> And I never heard of discussions - "let's take a couple of Pushkins, Griboyedov and get together after work in the park" even in the 80s .. Although no, I heard of course, but it had little to do with literature relationship :)) </p>
<p> "" was the most reading country in the world "</p>
<p> And then they took it and stopped, right? I don't believe :) "</p>
<p> but I believe. I've been in the 90s every Saturday, bought a book and read it all week;) I was very fond of science fiction. and then it became somehow expensive, there was no time, and you get tired - you fall asleep instead of reading. </p>
<p> e-books are not that, not in the sense that they "read wrong". no. here I just went to where they sell books. looked, picked it up, or how I stupidly bought a new one from the series - and went to read. the process is important. but in the net I fig knows what to look for. </p>
<p> "but in the net I fig knows what to look for something" </p>
<p> Don't know what to look for - subscribe to Flibusta's RSS feed, or some other online library. It is possible not for all sections, but only for those of interest. Every day you will receive a list of receipts, with a short description. Surely in a week at least one interesting book will come across :) </p>
<p> "in the 90s I went to buy a book every Saturday and read it all week" </p>
<p> I could only afford it once a month, with a scholarship. And then a computer, a mobile phone, the Internet appeared. It became possible to read anything and anywhere. I no longer perceive ordinary paper books - the font is small, gray, the hated typeface with serifs (and cannot be changed), the paper is gray, the text on the back is translucent. Yes, and I got a habit of keeping three running readers on the tablet at once - one book does not go, I switch to another. With paper bricks, this trick is definitely not possible :)) </p>
