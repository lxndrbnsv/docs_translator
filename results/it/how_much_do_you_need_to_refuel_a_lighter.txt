<p> Now let's look at how to fill a lighter with gas using a can. To do this, they grip it tightly in the hand and turn it over. Next, the tip of the gas container is inserted into the valve located at the bottom and pressed hard. It takes 5-10 seconds to hold the can in this way. Then he is abruptly pulled away from the lighter. Be sure to hold the can only with the nipple down. In the event that everything is done correctly, you will not feel the characteristic chill, since the gas will not come out, but go straight into the lighter body. </p>

<p> During refueling, a characteristic hissing sound will be heard. Some cans are equipped with special dispensers. In this case, you will have to refuel in several stages. Filling the casing with gas refers to adiabatic processes, which are always accompanied by a certain decrease in temperature. Therefore, before you start using the lighter, you should wait a little while it warms up. It won't take much time - no more than five minutes. </p>
<p> Sometimes the owners of expensive imported lighters, without risking holding such an event on their own, are interested in where to refuel the lighter for money. This is usually done by specialized workshops. Residents of small towns, most likely, still have to pick up a spray can and refuel the lighter on their own. It will not be difficult to find a suitable workshop for those living in megacities. For example, Muscovites who own Dupont lighters have the opportunity to take them to the top floor of the Central Department Store, to the official representative of Dupont. </p>
<p> Thus, now you understand how to fill the lighter with gas. If you have skilled hands, this will not be difficult. </p>
