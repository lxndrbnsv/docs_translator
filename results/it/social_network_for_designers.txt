<p> Social media design </p>
<p> A company's image on social media is a delicate matter. One time period, everything is fine, and the audience positively perceives your company, and very soon a flurry of criticism falls on you. In fact, there is nothing out of the ordinary here and the usual marketing mechanisms are involved in everything. Any success or failure of a company in the Internet space is explainable and decomposed into several components, one of which is the design of social networks. </p>
<p> An organization's social media design plays a big role in attracting new audiences and retaining old ones. It should combine elements of corporate style, be associated with the activities of the company, and most importantly, be pleasing to the visual perception. </p>
<p> Features of creating a company design in social networks </p>
<p> It's not enough to come up with a colorful avatar or public page cover in order to attract an audience with a design. It is necessary to develop a whole strategy for filling the company's profile in social networks. <b> The concept of social media design hides a whole host of individual elements: </b> </p>
<p> <b> Typical templates for posts. </b> </p>
<p> There are two options for design development in social networks: </p>
<p> The company already has its own corporate style and needs to shift it to the design of social networks; </p>
<p> The company is just beginning its development and, in principle, there is no corporate identity. In this case, the concept of the corporate style is invented in advance, and after that the design of the communities. </p>
<p> <b> It is also important to understand that not every social network has its own structure, for which it is necessary to develop a design. </b> </p>
<p> So, for example, there is no community cover on Instagram, but a lot of emphasis is placed on the logo and typical templates for posts. And in Vkontakte there are community covers, and avatars, and the possibility of posting, and company products, which must also correspond to the general design concept. </p>
<p> Why do you need to design a community in social networks? </p>
<p> First of all - the image. A well-developed design of social networks will play into the hands of the company's image on the Internet. The design will evoke lasting associations with you, engage the target audience and retain the existing one; </p>
<p> Originality and peculiarity of the proposal. It's no secret that the design reflects the main features of the company's work. So that's professional development </p>
<p> The design combines the uniqueness of the overall concept and the transmission of the basic principles of the company. </p>
<p> Usability. It is much easier for social media users to navigate well-designed communities. </p>

<h1> 5 Social Media Every Designer Should Know </h1>
<p> The emergence of thematic social networks provides new opportunities for people with common interests or working in the same field. Designers are particularly fortunate, as there are several social media sites created specifically for them. The Internet offers many opportunities for designers to communicate, exchange ideas, and improve their skills. We've compiled a list of the most interesting social networks where creative people can explore each other's work, get inspiration and share their opinions. </p>
<h2> Dribbble </h2>

<p> <strong> Dribbble </strong> has been dubbed a “Twitter for Designers” (as well as developers and other creatives) where they can share and showcase their work. Dribbble is a true hub for activity and inspiration. It has become a platform for a growing number of talented and innovative people. </p>
<p> Dribbble contributors share their work in the form of "shots" - small images of the work they are working on at the moment. Other contributors view these works and leave their comments about the submitted works. </p>
<p> You can register there as a subscriber - a designer who wants to be invited to the community and add your work there, or as a customer if you are looking for a designer for a project. By the way, if you follow the link dribbble.com/colors, you will find a good color matching tool for the site, which may come in handy. </p>

<p> <strong> Threadless </strong> is a social media platform for artists built like an online store. The artwork featured on Threadless is created by a community of professional designers. Every week, a new designer T-shirt or other item is posted on the site, for which visitors vote. Site administrators track the most popular works and select a winner, whose drawings are eventually printed on clothing and other goods. These items are then sold in an online store or an off-line store in Chicago. Works for Threadless range from really pretty and elegant to eccentric. There is never too much creativity and talent. </p>

DeviantArt features original work in a variety of styles, from traditional art forms such as paintings and sculptures to digital art, pixel art, films and anime. At the same time, it is believed that not quite ordinary works are posted on DeviantArt, but mostly on the topic of fantasy, made in a dark style. </p>

<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "http://design-mania.ru/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" /> </p>
<p> <strong> Fontli </strong> is a favorite fetish of everyone who literally breathes design. This is Instagram for typography fans. Yes, you read that right, this is a real calligraphic paradise. Like Instagram, when you open Fontli, the first thing you see is a news feed with photos posted by other people. Fontli contributors can upload photos of the fonts they like and name them using regular tags. Then Fontli can give more detailed information about this font, for example, the name of its designer. You can view popular posts and go to the pages of other members to familiarize yourself with the posted material. Fontli is now available on iPhone and Windows, and will soon be available on Android as well. </p>
<h2> ColourLovers </h2>
