<h1> What does an overestimated PSI mean among young people? Decryption and translation </h1>
<p> Among the thousands of topical memes on the Internet, you have probably met jokes about an overestimated PSV hundreds of times. This slang expression is most often used by young people. </p>
<p> Today you will find out what it means for a human being! We'll talk about decoding the word and other interesting details associated with this meme. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://bestcube.space/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<h2> How it stands </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> Let's start with the most interesting - with the decryption. <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://bestcube.space/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> <strong> PSV - self-importance </strong>. By the way, some users decipher this as a sense of their own greatness, which can also be considered the right option. Unfortunately, in our time, this ailment occurs in many, and especially among young people. </p>
<p> A teenager who has an off-scale CHSV requires special treatment. He completely sincerely considers himself better than other guys, is endowed with self-confidence and has his own opinion on everything. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://bestcube.space/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> But in fact, the importance of such young people is greatly exaggerated. By the way, if someone made a joke about the fact that you have an overestimated PSI, you should know that this is by no means a compliment! <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://bestcube.space/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> It seems to us that people who now and then indulge a sense of self-importance can be called selfish! </p>
<h2> How is CHSV translated </h2>
<p> This is just slang that comes from the abbreviation of the words Sense of Self Importance and is not translated in any way. In other words, it's just an abbreviation that means absolutely nothing in English. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://bestcube.space/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<h2> Teenage PSV </h2>
<p> CHSV is most often used in youth slang, and for a reason. The transitional age is directly related to the appearance of an excessive (and even painful) sense of self-importance. </p>
<p> It's just that young people need the approval of those around them, they need to earn the respect of their peers at any cost. You really want to be popular and in demand. The guys' PCS is gaining momentum, but, unfortunately, the results are very disappointing. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://bestcube.space/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> A teenager with an overestimated sense of self-importance looks vain and self-centered. And this, as a rule, repels others from him. </p>
<p> Even the child's friends and parents find it hard to endure this state of affairs, so conflicts and quarrels are brewing. The relationship cracks and the teen begins to suffer. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://bestcube.space/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> At first glance, ChSV is just a funny meme and the caustic jokes associated with it. But if you dig deeper, it becomes clear that this is a very negative character trait that you need to get rid of as soon as possible. </p>
<h2> Inflated HR </h2>
<p> It is very easy to identify people with high HRV! It is enough to look at their manner of communication, behavior with friends and family, and at least once to see a person in an uncomfortable environment for him. Everything immediately becomes clear. </p>
<p> By the way, on the Internet, you can easily spot people with inflated HSPs. Pay attention to their comments and writing style. Such people love to teach everyone around the wisdom and in every possible way to attract attention. They want to demonstrate their uniqueness and “coolness” to the whole world. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> But it's not cool at all. <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://bestcube.space/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
