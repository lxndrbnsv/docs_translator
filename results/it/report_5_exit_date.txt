<p> Author <strong> Vladik </strong> asked a question in the section <strong> Cinema, Theater </strong> </p>
<p> whether the 5th part of the film will be filmed a report from the underworld and got the best answer </p>
<p> Answer from Inspiration [guru] <br /> <strong> I haven't watched the film, but in theory there shouldn't have been such premises, since the film was originally intended as the series finale (i.e., there will be no sequels) : <br /> Inspiration <br /> Higher intelligence <br /> (158117) <br /> Regarding the ending: at the end of that interview, the director himself really says that someone might have perceived her this way </strong> < / p>

<h1> Film "Report" and its subsequent parts </h1>
<p> Hello, today I would not like to share anymore, but to find an answer to why some (or rather almost all) films sin with an excellent first part and a kind of degradation of subsequent ones. In my opinion, the creators are either in a hurry to release a sequel to the first story so successfully shot, taking advantage of the fact that it was a success and has not yet been forgotten by time, or simply lose enthusiasm for one reason or another, or simply conceit in the spirit of "the first part rolled, it means it will and the second. " I think that everyone will have in their memory at least three films that disappointed when watching part 2, 3, 4 .. or their remakes. </p>
<p> For me, a particular disappointment came when watching the sequels of the 2007 Spanish horror film "Report" by Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza </p>
<p> It was this 2007 film that became for me the standard of how a truly creepy and exciting horror movie should look like. No exaggeration! </p>
<p> A little about the plot .. It is undoubtedly different from the template of this genre, but all the relish is in the atmosphere of the film, which the creators made really scary. </p>
<blockquote> <p> All journalists crave sensations! But aspiring TV reporter Angela Vidal from the chronicle of incidents - thirsts especially passionately. With enviable persistence, she is looking for unique material, and therefore travels with a team of rescuers to the scene of a terrible incident in a large residential building. </p> </blockquote>
<p> Arriving there, Angela, recklessly busy with work, does not immediately understand where she is reporting from. Realization of the terrible reality comes too late. The inhabitants of the house, affected by a terrible virus, turn into zombies one by one. To prevent the infection from breaking out into the streets of the city, the authorities blocked the house - there is no way out! But the camera will work until the end ... </p> </blockquote>
<p> And the whole relish is that the shooting is stylized as a documentary, and is conducted from the first person "through the eyes of the operator", a similar move can be seen in films such as "The Blair Witch" and "Paranormal Activity", but here it is not about a witch and not about evil ghosts, here about the very hackneyed "zombies", which even after JJ. Romero got the teeth on edge. However, the original concept of shooting with a "shaking camera" + a plot that makes the film exciting and not boring did their job and this film even surpassed the aforementioned sensational horror films to some extent. Even shooting within one not very large house throughout the film made it no worse than films about zombie apocalypses, where "ghouls" bother poor people on the scale of entire continents). In general, the first part of "Reportage" became no less than a horror film number 1 in my collection because it was really creepy and the creators coped with the task of scaring the viewer by a solid five! </p>
<p> <iframe src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nh-mpaZZ8yo?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque"> </iframe> </p>
<p> Upon learning that this film has 2 more parts, I was delighted and thought that from such a volume of "horrors" it would not be bad to first drink a motherwort before watching. But if the second part was still close to the first, then the third was already more a satire-parody film on the genre of "zombie apocalypse" and was perceived more as a comedy, a kind of comedy .. </p>
<p> So, about the second part. </p>
<p> "Report from the underworld", 2009. Filmed by the same directors. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://astv.ru/Content/article/96/6a/8ec7-aee2-414f-a19d-b12ce3da2c4b/d24cd09a-c9a3-4d3e-b34d-c4c9d791b65d .jpg "/> </p>
<p> The plot tells about the continuation of the events of the first part .. The events unfold in the same house. </p>
<blockquote> <p> A detachment of special forces, together with a medical worker, enter the house, which has become the epicenter of a spreading infection that turns people into mad flesh eaters ... </p> </blockquote>
<p> And despite the fact that the style is the same and the cast has not changed, the film is a little disappointing in the sense that if you mix beer with vodka in one glass and drink nothing good. In the same film, one director (Paco Plaza), a fan of exorcism and "obsession", weaved into such a perfectly perceived story of infection with an unknown virus: crosses from which zombies "sausage" in every possible way, priest and other attributes worthy of films of a slightly different direction. That would seem such a small nuance, but already a fly in the ointment in a barrel of honey .. But in general, the film also has a lot of action, atmosphere and even somewhere too much .. which again makes it clear that the directors managed to withstand the "golden mean" more in the first part, where a specific game was played with the viewer, which somehow smoothly prepared the viewer, gave him the opportunity to take "respite" from moments that were too violent. </p>
<p> <iframe src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/px7INlb-Koc?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque"> </iframe> </p>
<p> The third part, is called "Report 3: Inception", this film was released in 2012 and was filmed this time by one of the directors, namely P. Plaza, who disappointed me so much in his contribution in the second part. / p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://astv.ru/Content/article/96/6a/8ec7-aee2-414f-a19d-b12ce3da2c4b/fc8593f0-29f6-47b9-b628-6d68d4805e04 .jpg "/> </p>
<p> Here the director, obviously, decided to move away from the role of the previous two parts and made a kind of parody of Hollywood blockbusters about zombies. For me, it was a disappointment not even from the fact that the expectations from the film did not come true and under the loud name of the favorite horror film turned out to be a boring and stereotyped film, albeit on a larger scale and high budget, but the fact that I realized that it was such a parody with a humorous slope only at the end. </p>
<p> According to the plot, the actions of this part develop chronologically simultaneously with the first two. </p>
<p> In short, the "infectious" puppy of the girl from the first part, who bit the veterinarian (the wedding guest) of the second part, put the turn of a bloody meat grinder at the celebration with all the consequences .. There are all the brand chips of such films and nothing original. Even filming from the first person was removed, you bastards .. however, as it turned out that those who watched the "reports" have a very similar opinion about this part. </p>
<blockquote> <p> To summarize: you can watch a movie, but only for the sake of the surprise that you will experience at what a great movie has become, or if you just watched all the zombie movies. </p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p> After watching the first two parts, I became a true fan of Reportage, but after looking at the last one, I regretted the 80 minutes that I wasted. The main disappointment for me was that Paco Plaza moved away from the genre of pseudo-documentary and filmed in the traditional way. The film script is terribly readable. The only difference from the previous parts is that the action of the film takes place not in one house, but on a large territory, otherwise everything is copied from previous reports. However, the third part looks like just a cheap parody of the first two. </p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p> After waiting for the rip from the DVD, and immediately watching it, I felt deceived, a victim of the director, who sensed the profit, and hastily put together this part. </p> </blockquote>
<p> Some excerpts from reviews on the KinoPoisk website. </p>
<p> <iframe src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHt-HaNgER0?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque"> </iframe> </p>
<p> And now, recently, we found the 4th part of 2014. Which is called "Reporting: Apocalypse" and promises to be a natural continuation of the second without any innovative improvisations. However, from the experience of watching the "gorgeous" third part, I previewed the trailer. Actually, here it is: </p>
<p> <iframe src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/K2fUND8VpC0?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque"> </iframe> </p>
<blockquote> <p> Angela wakes up on a ship in the middle of the ocean. After an outbreak of an unknown virus that turns people into zombies, scientists decided to isolate infected, but not sick people in order to investigate the nature of the infection. A specially equipped former oil tanker has all the necessary equipment for laboratory experiments. But, neither the scientists nor the team even know what awaits them. After all, the infected carry death for all mankind. </p> </blockquote>
<p> And already having the idea that the film will already be outdated, I looked. And I regretted it. Boring, hackneyed, banal, copied from "Resident Evil" in some moments, a very trivial horror film. </p>
<p> So I think, was it worth it to undermine your authority in a so jaded viewer who loved the radically fresh and "not worn out" first 2 parts? Maybe it was better to stop and continue working on some new project, rather than continue speculating on the name? In general, it's a pity .. </p>

<h2> Plot [edit | edit code] </h2>
<p> The journalist Angela Vidal did not die, and after the events of the film "Report from the Underworld" she was quarantined on a trawler specially equipped for such purposes. It turns out that it carries a strange and deadly infection that is dangerous to humanity. </p>
<p> The events begin with the fact that a special forces detachment mines a house through which the infection has spread. Journalist Angela Vidal is the only survivor. One of the soldiers, Guzman, approaches her and tells her that it is time to leave and she is evacuated. Then Angela wakes up in some laboratory, where Dr. Hinard examines her. When asked if she remembers what happened, she replies no and asks to loosen the belts. The doctor does this, after which Angela easily breaks free, beats him and runs away. She is subsequently caught. She learns that she is on the ship. </p>
<p> Guzman communicates with IT specialist Nick and the captain of the ship Ortega, for whom this is the last voyage. Ortega says he has been ordered to cut off any contact with the mainland, and Nick is trying to recover the tape from Angela's video camera. Nick reveals to Guzman that he hacked into security cameras and is monitoring scientists in the lab. </p>
<p> The next day, Angela meets Nick, who says that he is a big fan of her, and shows his work. Angela recognizes the camera footage. After viewing Nick sends all materials to the laboratory. Meanwhile, the cook is attacked by an infected laboratory monkey. He beats the animal, then fry it in a pan, but the blood gets on the food. One of the soldiers dissatisfied with the lack of food comes to check how things are, but does not answer his questions, and he takes the food to the dining room. One of the passengers - an elderly lady who survived the events of the third film - complains that the food is too heavy for her stomach, and asks to cook something more dietary for her. Soldier Lucas walks into the kitchen and an infected cook pounces on him. After a lengthy fight, Lucas manages to lock him in the freezer. Ricarte says that he has invented an antidote that he wants to test on the coca, but he showed no signs of recovery. Part of the crew has already become infected after eating, the situation is complicated by the fact that a storm is approaching. </p>
<p> Ricarte is sure that there is no healing and starts the "self-destruct protocol", but he is stopped, showing the restored record. The camera shoots Angela fighting the possessed girl, but she first drags the journalist into the darkness, and then infects her with obsession by transferring a worm-like creature from mouth to mouth. Ricarte thinks that you can only get the antidote from Angela. </p>
<p> Ricarte and his men attack Angela, intending to operate on her and extract the parasite, but they are attacked by Ortega, and Angela manages to escape. Ricarte catches up with her. Angela bites him to prove she is not infected. After analyzing his blood, Ricarte sees that it is not infected. However, he thinks Angela is possessed and somehow tricked him. </p>
<p> The infection is spreading throughout the ship. The old lady and Lucas are killed. The ship fills with the possessed. It becomes known that Guzman is also possessed. Angela realizes that the parasite left her body in the house where the events of the first two films take place, when Guzmán was left alone with her and tried to persuade her to go with him. Then the parasite found a stronger host, which turned out to be Guzman. He attacks Angela, trying to bring the parasite back into her body, but Nick impales him with a harpoon. Ricarte launches a "self-destruct protocol". Nick, exterminating zombies, tries to save Angela. Together they jump into an inflatable raft, after which the ship explodes. After the explosion, the barracuda is shown swallowing a parasite worm that survived the explosion, thus showing that the "obsession" is spreading and the Apocalypse is inevitable. </p>
<p> In the pre-credits scene, Nick and Angela get into a taxi, and the taxi driver, noticing their slightly shabby appearance, asks if they had a good time. </p>

<p> All compositions were recorded by Arnau Batalier [4]. </p>
<p> The film received mixed reviews. He, like the previous part, was criticized for moving away from the genre of pseudo-documentary, which gave the first two parts more realism. At the same time, the film has an 81% rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website [5]. The rating is quite high, provided that the sequels were unable to repeat the success of the original, and the fourth film rekindled interest in the series. </p>
