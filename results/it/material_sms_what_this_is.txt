<h1> What makes nonwovens different </h1>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "http: //xn--80akmgjkng.xn--p1ai/upload/iblock/1e1/1e1e84abb75eb24b5d01d2b3140c6d63.jpg" /> </p>
<p> Nonwovens are one of the fastest growing sectors of the textile industry. Over the past 10 years, there has been a 300% increase in production. This trend is due to the low cost of production, as well as the speed of fabrication. <br /> </p>
<p> <b> Nonwovens are divided into 3 types: </b> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Spunlace. The main difference is the way the fibers are bundled - using water jets. </li>
  <li> Spundbond. Made from fused polymers. </li>
  <li> For manufacturing, polymer blowing is used. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2> Applications </h2>
<p> Nonwovens are widely used in medical institutions - due to the fact that the surface is covered with a layer of polymer, they are completely sterile. In addition, the advisability of using such materials in medicine is due to the fact that they are environmentally friendly and are inert to chemical and biological influences. From these materials are made: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Napkins. </li>
  <li> Disposable garments. </li>
  <li> Medical masks. </li>
  <li> Sheets. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2> Spunbond </h2>
<p> This material consists of polypropylene threads, which are bonded together under the influence of high temperatures. It is most commonly used to make lingerie or disposable clothing. The main advantages of spunbond are affordable prices and complete bioinertness. During the manufacture of the material, polypropylene must be processed to eliminate harmful bacteria and impurities. </p>
<p> The density of spunbond is 42 grams per square meter, but at the same time it is highly resistant to moisture and practically impervious to air. Also, its advantage can be attributed to the simplicity in the manufacture of products. The material can be welded, and prints easily fit onto its surface. Spunbond features a complete absence of toxicity. The material is completely hypoallergenic, easy to sterilize, which, coupled with a wide range of colors, is a logical explanation for its popularity. </p>
<h3> Advantages and advantages of the material: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Available rates. </li>
  <li> Environmentally friendly. </li>
  <li> Strength. </li>
  <li> Hypoallergenic. </li>
  <li> Non-toxic. </li>
  <li> Easy to sew. </li>
  <li> Easy to sterilize. </li>
  <li> Holds prints well. </li>
</ul>
<h3> Spunbond various industrial fields </h3>
<p> In the furniture industry, the material is used in the manufacture of covers or upholstery of mattresses from the inside. It is also used for upholstered furniture upholstery - chairs, armchairs, sofas, etc. The material practically does not absorb dirt and repels dust particles, which makes it easy to clean. Laminated spunbond and spunlace are used in products that should not allow moisture and liquid to pass through. </p>
<p> In haberdashery spunbond can be used as the inner lining of suitcases, as well as the outer surface of bags. This is advisable due to the high wear resistance of the material. </p>
<p> Spunbond is also used in footwear - due to the fact that the material is quite easy to cut and has sufficient strength characteristics, insoles, lining and other shoe elements are made from it. </p>
<p> Spunbond can be used to make protective clothing for chefs, medical workers, electronics engineers, and fashion salon employees. These garments can be used one time only, but they can also be sterilized, washed or cleaned and reused. </p>
<p> Due to its high resistance to chemical attack (the ability to resist acid and alkaline solutions), as well as high temperatures, spunbond is widely used in medical institutions. One of its most common uses is to make disposable bedding, medical clothing, protective equipment, and wipes. </p>
<h2> Spunlace </h2>
<p> Production of spunlace material has a non-standard manufacturing technology. Under the influence of a jet of water, which is released under pressure, the weaving of the fibers is maintained. The material contains a web of staple yarns that have previously passed the forming process. </p>
<p> Thanks to the use of innovative technologies based on the spinneret weaving method, manufacturers use furniture products, medical instruments and consumables as a filler. The raw materials used have a percentage of 70 viscose and 30 polyester. The use of disposable sterile clothing and linen has significant effectiveness by reducing the risk of contracting hospital-acquired infections. </p>
<h3> Material Advantages </h3>
<ul>
  <li> good susceptibility to moisture absorption; </li>
  <li> protective properties - achieved through the content of particles with the addition of special substances; </li>
  <li> resistance to dust, various pollution occurs with biologically active substances. Demand for application in the medical industry when sewing medical clothing; </li>
