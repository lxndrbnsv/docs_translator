<h1> Wacom Tablet, Driver Not Responding or Not Working, Troubleshooting </h1>
<p> I recently bought a tablet <b> One by Wacom (CTL-671) </b>, installed the driver from the disk, did everything according to the instructions and nothing starts. </p>
<p> Writes the following: "Tablet driver not responding". </p>

<p> Opening the control center, but the tablet is not listed. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <br /> <img src = "https://habrastorage.org/webt/px/gd/qq/pxgdqqu6kolxfusjuuzuj7arty4.jpeg" /> <br /> </p>
<p> Let's look at how the tablet is recognized by the computer and see that the Wacom Tablet is recognized normally. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <br /> <img src = "https://habrastorage.org/webt/ia/x1/xp/iax1xpsliidtmfvclsowkmw0swm.jpeg" /> <br /> </p>
<p> After spending 18 hours in torture trying to start the driver, I heard a rumor that it should be installed in the default directory. For me, it was changed through the registry to drive D so that the system partition does not get clogged. </p>
<p> But even after installing in the "Program Files (x86)" directory, it would not start. And then I turned to the Microsoft program "Process Monitor" and began to monitor the driver's behavior and then a very curious thing turned out ... (besides the fact that there are a lot of non-existent files and errors associated with this in the installation logs) </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://habrastorage.org/webt/tu/rm/gt/turmgtaxi6fqjuyu8rnotxd0eqs.jpeg" /> </p>
<p> The driver suddenly tried to find two files. One does not exist, and the other is located in a completely different "Program Files" directory, from which I conclude that the developers of this driver directly indicated where to access the driver, but did not affect the installation process itself. As a confirmation, I later noticed access to another file in the same way along the strictly specified path. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://habrastorage.org/webt/ru/ha/1r/ruha1rck5tdqp-ewnjdl_xxplks.jpeg" /> </p>
<p> This means that the <strong> Wacom driver must be located strictly at: C: \ Program Files \ Tablet </strong> and nowhere else. </p>
<h3> What to do? </h3>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://habrastorage.org/webt/qm/xb/c4/qmxbc4ozeczohdt1-apzqc6jehk.jpeg" /> <br /> Only such processes as in the screenshot should remain in the system after reinstalling the driver (relevant for version 6.3. 31). </p>

<p style = "clear: both"> I also advise you to open the "Wacom Tablet File Utility" and delete the settings for all users. <br /> <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://habrastorage.org/webt/pl/_b/m_/pl_bm_47dhxrytt4hn4_v4003-w.jpeg" /> </p>
<p> The tablet can now be connected, it will install and the Wacom welcome screen will open! </p>
<p> One way or another, the driver continues to access the file "<strong> Tablet \ Wacom \ WTabletServicePro.ilk </strong>", which does not exist and what role it plays, I do not understand, if anyone has this file, let me know. </p>
<p> <strong> Additional problems: </strong> <br /> The tablet may stop working - the driver is closed again. It must be restarted without turning off the tablet. </p>
<p> On the Internet it is proposed to create a file "<em> any name </em> .cmd" </p>
<p> And write in it: </p>
<p> (For Bamboo Series) </p>
<p> This is such a quick way to restart the driver. The tablet will be recognized again and the control window will open. But I think it is necessary for the service to create a start / restart event when the tablet is connected to the computer. </p>

<h1> Why is my graphics tablet blinking </h1>
<p> I connect the tablet to the computer, the light comes on, but when I start moving the stylus, the cursor on the monitor does not move. When I press the tablet surface with the stylus, the light blinks, as in normal work. I wore it to fix it, but when I connected it to another computer, everything worked fine. I already changed the tips. <br /> I have already reinstalled the driver. <br /> Is there a problem in the pen or in the computer itself? 8 years </p>
