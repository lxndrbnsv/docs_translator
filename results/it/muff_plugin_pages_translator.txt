<h2> How to translate a page in Mozile into Russian </h2>
<p> Unfortunately, the standard version of the Internet browser Mozilla Firefox does not automatically translate the text portion of the website, but this should not be a reason to change the browser. </p>
<p> There are a large number of services for online conversion of web pages from one language to another, as well as an equally extensive list of software modules that can "teach" the user's browser to translate text from various foreign sites. </p>
<p> There are several solutions and methods to translate pages in Firefox. </p>
<p> Of these, there are two most common types of translation of pages from a foreign language into Russian. The difference between them lies in converting the entire text of the site or of a specific fragment of printed material that interests the user. Of course, no one talks about professional translation, which takes into account all the nuances of a particular field of activity, but in order to understand the general meaning of the text of a web resource, this should be enough (especially since the average user, with a small percentage of exclusion, often does not encounter with difficult to read professional and technical documentation). </p>
