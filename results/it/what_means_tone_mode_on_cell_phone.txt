<p> Pulse mode is a method in which the digits of the dialed number are transmitted through serial closure and pulse generation. Many users could find such phones 10-15 years ago, where dialing was done using a disk. With each transfer of the disc, clicks were heard in the tube. The number of clicks matched the selected digit, and only 0 produced 10 clicks. There were also push-button versions of pulse telephones. </p>
