<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://instagramix.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> The reasons why Instagram is not installed on Android are more often: lack of free memory, outdated version of the operating system, technical failures within the social network. </p>
<h2> Why Instagram won't install </h2>
<p> Basically, the user loses access to Instagram for the following reasons: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> installing major updates; </li>
  <li> lack of free memory; </li>
  <li> problems in the Play Market; </li>
  <li> SD card installed as default storage for download; </li>
  <li> non-compliance with the technical requirements of the smartphone. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<blockquote> <p> The Downdetector website will help to make sure that Instagram is active and the problem does not concern only one user. </p> </blockquote>
<p> Account holders from all over the world leave comments where they describe problems when working on Instagram. Also shown is a graph with increasing error reports. </p>
<h3> Method 1: not enough memory on the device </h3>
<p> One of the problems why Instagram is not installed on Android is the lack of memory on the mobile device. In addition, Stories ceases to function in the service and media content does not load. </p>
<p> If Instagram is not installed on Android, follow: </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <ol>
  <li> Smartphone settings - <strong> Apps </strong>. </li>
  <li> Select "Instagram" from the list. <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://instagramix.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </li>
  <li> <strong> Clear cache or Clear data </strong>. <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://instagramix.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> If this method did not help in solving the problem, it is better to reinstall the application. This will delete all passwords and logins that were used for authorization. </p>
<h3> Method 2: install the old version </h3>
<p> The old version of the application is suitable for owners of outdated devices. For example, if the smartphone is no longer updated or its specifications do not meet the requirements of Instagram. </p>
<p> If Instagram is not downloading or the installation is interrupted: </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <ol>
  <li> Go to <strong> Smartphone Settings </strong> - <strong> Applications </strong>. </li>
  <li> Find Instagram - <strong> Stop and Delete </strong>. </li>
  <li> Download the hacked version in <strong> APK </strong> format. <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://instagramix.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </li>
  <li> Transfer to phone - press: <strong> "Open" </strong>. </li>
  <li> Install. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> Previously, to use it, you need to specify in the parameters of the mobile device: "<strong> Installation from unknown sources </strong>". Also, this version is not updated. The only option that remains for active users is the browser version of Instagram. </p>
<h3> Method 3: technical failures </h3>
<p> When working with the Play Market, an error occurs that does not allow installing Instagram on Android. </p>
<p> Reasons why the problem occurs: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> transferring data to SD card; </li>
  <li> no stable internet or VPN connection; </li>
  <li> internal service error. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> To install Instagram: </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <ol>
  <li> Smartphone settings - <strong> Applications </strong>. </li>
  <li> Play Market - <strong> Uninstall Updates </strong>. <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://instagramix.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </li>
  <li> Re-enter the Google store - log in. </li>
  <li> Wait for updates - install Instagram. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> Or else: remove the social network and reinstall, without transferring to the SD card. In the future, the user will have to clear the cache more often to get rid of unnecessary files. If the problem occurs not only with Instagram, changing the external storage will help. </p>
<h2> Download Instagram without viruses for free </h2>
<p> Download Instagram will help the Apptoide application and the w3bsit3-dns.com forum. The user needs to find the latest updates that have been released. </p>
<p> How to install from Apptoide: </p>
<p> <ol>
  <li> Go to the official website of the application. </li>
  <li> Download <strong> APK file - install. </strong> </li>
  <li> Open - enter in the search: "<strong> Instagram". </strong> </li>
  <li> Wait for the installation to complete. </li>
  <li> Run. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<blockquote> <p> It is best and safest to download the .APK file from our website </p> </blockquote>
<p> By regularly checking Apptoide, the smartphone owner will know about new versions and will be able to update in a timely manner. If Instagram is not installed on Android, you need to check compliance with the technical requirements. </p>
<p> Going to the page in the Play Market, the user will see the inscription: "Your device is not supported." In this case, updating the operating system or changing the smartphone to a new model will help. </p>

<h1> Instagram is not installed on the phone: why and what to do </h1>
<p> If Instagram is not installed on Android, then the reason may be: a software failure, full memory, no Internet connection, or a mismatch in the application version. </p>
<h2> Can't install on the phone: reasons and solutions </h2>
<p> The main reason why Instagram is not installed is that the version of the smartphone operating system is outdated. This happens if the user has disabled automatic updates or the phone is simply not supported by the manufacturer. Typically, the support period is up to two to three years with regular updates. If the device was marked as "defective" or "limited version" - the support period may be shorter. </p>
<blockquote> <p> To determine that the device is no longer supported by the social network is possible through the item "Settings" - About phone - Software update. The category will indicate the time of the last download of the version, as well as the availability of current new versions. The same applies to the iOS system, where legacy smartphones are offered simplified versions. </p> </blockquote>
<p> Other reasons why Instagram is not installed: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> poor or unstable internet connection; </li>
  <li> errors on Instagram not related to user actions; </li>
  <li> poor device specifications; </li>
  <li> smartphone cache is not cleared and full. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> With low technical characteristics, the user can only change the smartphone or use the Lite version. For example, the error occurs on iPhone 4. </p>
<h3> iPhone </h3>
<p> Problems with the iOS system are related to both updating and the sudden termination of the application. </p>
<p> The second type of problem appears less frequently, but it can be caused by: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> smartphone memory is full; </li>
  <li> a different version of the application was previously installed; </li>
  <li> traffic restrictions. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> If the owner of a smartphone often uses a mobile connection with download restrictions, you need to remove the limits and connect to Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> How to uninstall a previously installed version of the application: </p>
<p> <ol>
  <li> Find the Instagram icon on your desktop. </li>
  <li> Pinch with your finger until a cross appears on top. </li>
  <li> Click: Delete. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> Now you need to update your smartphone and reinstall Instagram from the AppStore. The problem could be in the device cache or previously not updated versions of the application. </p>
<h3> Android </h3>
<p> If Instagram is not installed on Honor 8c, then you need to clear the smartphone cache. Also, Android users have an internal Play Market error. But in this case, none of the applications on the smartphone will be able to install or update. To resolve the error, you need to uninstall the latest Play Market updates, restart your phone and log in again. </p>
<p> How to clear cache on Android devices: </p>
<ul>
  <li> install third-party cleaning apps; </li>
  <li> do a manual cleanup. </li>
</ul>
<p> It should be remembered that in addition to the "Cache" section, memory is occupied by the "Other" folder, which stores downloaded files, thumbnails of saved photos or videos. </p>
<p> How to clear the cache: </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <ol>
  <li> Go to mobile device settings. </li>
  <li> Memory and Storage - Clear. <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://storins.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </li>
  <li> Select a section: "Cash" - click: "Delete". <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https://storins.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> Wait while the system calculates the amount of free space and go to the Play Market. The smartphone is affected by a restart, and if you do not perform it at least once a week, the device may show errors, slow down or not download files. </p>
<h2> Other versions of mobile phones </h2>
<p> The problem with downloading and installing occurs due to the firmware installed by the manufacturer. For example, Xiaomi redmi note is not equipped with standard Android, but specially created for a mobile device. In this case, the user can install the APK version of the social network or update the operating system. More often than not, errors and problems do not occur. </p>
<p> Harder to install on Windows devices. The operating system is no longer supported and mobile applications are no longer available for them. Device owners can only use older versions of Instagram. A browser version is available, which is different from the application, but has almost the same functionality. </p>
<blockquote> <p> An error when Instagram is not installed on Android, iPhones or Windows Phone is solved by checking the Internet connection. It is not recommended to connect from a mobile network or use a VPN to work with the site. </p> </blockquote>

<h1> Why Instagram won't install and how to solve it </h1>
<p> When working with social networks, error 910 occurs or Instagram is not installed on Android for other reasons: not enough free memory, the flash card does not work, or the device does not meet the required technical parameters. </p>
<h2> Reasons why Instagram is not installed </h2>
<p> List of reasons why Instagram is not installed: </p>
<ul>
  <li> no stable internet connection; </li>
  <li> not enough free memory in internal storage; </li>
  <li> USB stick is not working or damaged; </li>
  <li> latest Play Market update; </li>
  <li> not working .apk file. </li>
</ul>
<p> To rule out other errors, the user must restart their smartphone and delete Instagram. After - put on download and wait for installation. If the procedure has not started, check the Android version. 6.0 and higher are suitable for normal work with a social network. </p>
<p> Problems arise if the owner of the phone does not follow the latest updates on Instagram and the operating system. It is recommended to specify automatic updates so as not to miss new versions of applications. </p>
<p> Check OS number: </p>
<ol>
  <li> <strong> Settings - About phone. <img src = "https: //xn--80aaakxpne3ahl.xn--p1ai/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </strong> </li>
  <li> <strong> Software update - System. <img src = "https: //xn--80aaakxpne3ahl.xn--p1ai/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </strong> </li>
</ol>
<blockquote> <p> If the code 910 appears on the screen during installation, then the problem is not with Instagram and Android, but with the latest Play Market update. Users note that version 13.7.15 often gives errors or simply does not start. </p> </blockquote>
<p> <strong> Note </strong>: Not all Android mobile devices can get the new version of the Content Store. The official community disconnects from support for smartphone manufacturers who use an unlicensed software format. </p>
<h2> Solution Methods </h2>
<p> To eliminate errors related to downloading, installing and configuring parameters, you need to reset the settings to the factory settings. The method is applicable in cases where other applications are not installed in addition to Instagram. Usually, it helps to completely delete data and cache or delete Instagram. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https: //xn--80aaakxpne3ahl.xn--p1ai/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" / > </p>
<p> Ways to solve the problem: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> stop Play Market and remove updates; </li>
  <li> clear cache and data in a standard way; </li>
  <li> restart phone and delete Instagram. Try downloading and installing again; </li>
  <li> reconnect to the internet. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> An unstable network connection often causes errors in an application. This manifests itself in slow-motion scrolling on the Ribbon, reduced video quality, and notifications that there is no connection. It happens because of work with mobile Internet and low speed of home. </p>
<h3> Method 1: reinstall Instagram </h3>
<p> If an update occurs rather than an initial download, a "perpetual install" occurs. The application is downloaded but not installed on the phone. The bug affects not only Instagram, but also other uploads. </p>
<p> To keep the download and delete Instagram: </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <ol>
  <li> Disconnect from the Internet. </li>
  <li> Go to smartphone settings - <strong> Applications. <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https: //xn--80aaakxpne3ahl.xn--p1ai/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </strong> </li>
  <li> In the list find <strong> "Instagram" - Stop. </strong> </li>
  <li> Delete and confirm actions. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> After that, restart your phone and connect to the network. Find the application in the Play Market and put it on download. </p>
<blockquote> <p> An error also occurs when the Russian language is not installed on Instagram. </p> </blockquote>
<p> Instructions on how to change language settings: </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <ol>
  <li> Log in to the social network. </li>
  <li> Open: <strong> Options - Account. <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https: //xn--80aaakxpne3ahl.xn--p1ai/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </strong> </li>
  <li> <strong> Language - select "Russian" from the list. <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https: //xn--80aaakxpne3ahl.xn--p1ai/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </strong> </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> If VPN or proxy access was enabled during the download, the application can be installed in English. </p>
<blockquote> <p> The settings are affected by the geographic data specified by the owner of the smartphone in the <strong> Google Account. </strong> They are required when registering the page and can be changed. To edit them, you need to go through the computer version to the official site "<strong> Google Account" </strong> and edit the previously specified information. </p> </blockquote>
<h3> Method 2: Remove Play Market Updates </h3>
<p> If Instagram is not installed and the error code is 910 in the content store, then the problem is in the Play Market. You can restore the service by removing and reinstalling the latest updates. </p>
<p> The procedure does not require installation of a store from third-party sources: by connecting to the Internet, the Play Market will automatically download to your mobile device. </p>
<blockquote> <p> The problem is also associated with versions of the operating system: it often occurs on Android 7.0 and below. </p> </blockquote>
<p> You can delete a store in the same way as for other applications: </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <ol>
  <li> <strong> Settings - Applications. <img style = "float: left; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;" src = "https: //xn--80aaakxpne3ahl.xn--p1ai/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </strong> </li>
  <li> <strong> Play Market - </strong> three dots at the top - <strong> Uninstall updates. </strong> </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> Will be automatically stopped, after removal - you need to enable it yourself. A less drastic way is to clear the cache and data. </p>
<p> Applies to Instagram, which consumes 100 MB of free memory per day. By regularly cleaning temporary files and data, the user will be able to avoid errors and incorrect operation of applications. </p>
<blockquote> <p> If Instagram is not installed on Android, the first thing to do is clear the cache and restart the smartphone. </p> </blockquote>
