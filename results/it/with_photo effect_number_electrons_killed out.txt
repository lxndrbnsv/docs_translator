<h1> The number of electrons knocked out during the photoelectric effect </h1>
<p> Please select the correct statement (s). </p>
<p> The kinetic energy of electrons knocked out of the metal during the photoelectric effect does not depend on </p>
<p> A. the frequency of the incident light. </p>
<p> B. the number of photons incident on the photocathode. </p>
<p> V. the area of ​​the illuminated surface. </p>
<p> According to the second law of the photoelectric effect, the maximum kinetic energy of electrons ejected by light increases linearly with the frequency of light and does not depend on its intensity. </p>

<p> We find that the kinetic energy of knocked out electrons depends on the frequency of the incident light and the work function of electrons from the metal and does not depend on the number of incident photons and the area of ​​the illuminated surface. </p>
