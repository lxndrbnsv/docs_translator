<p> You know those people who pick up your iPhone and start trying to guess the password. Try after try and the friend stops iOS, which says to disconnect the device for 1 minute. </p>
<p> After that, the person usually gives the smartphone and everything ends well. But for sure you have always been tormented by the question, what will happen if you enter the wrong password many times, how it all can end. </p>
<p> Let's deal with this situation. It's better to know right away what the consequences might be after such jokes. </p>
<h2> How many times can I enter a wrong password on my iPhone? </h2>
<p> Apple does not specify such information on their website, at least I did not find it. <br /> </p>
<p> But people have forgotten and will continue to forget passwords, so from user experience the scenario will be as follows: </p>
<p> <ol>
  <li> first enter the wrong password 6 times and a message appears - "iPhone is disabled, please try again in 1 minute"; </li>
  <li> when this period of time passes, we enter again and now we see - "iPhone is disabled, try again in 5 minutes" (this is already 7 attempts); </li>
  <li> wait again and after another attempt, a similar text appears - "iPhone is disabled, please try again in 15 minutes" (8 attempts); </li>
  <li> after a little thought, once again we are mistaken, and now - "iPhone is disabled, try again in 60 minutes" (this is already 9); </li>
  <li> after a whole hour, we enter the wrong 6 (4) digits and now we observe - "iPhone is disconnected, connect to iTunes" (10). </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> Thus, you have as many as 10 attempts to guess your password. After the last time, the device turns off and the only option is to connect your iPhone to iTunes. </p>
