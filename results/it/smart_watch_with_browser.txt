<p> Many 2017-2018 smartwatches run on the Android Wear platform. The functionality of such devices can be expanded by installing additional applications. Let's consider the most necessary and interesting ones. </p>
<h2> The installation process itself </h2>
<p> Let's consider how to install the application on a smart watch. The fact is that there is no store specifically for such gadgets, and not all are suitable from the play market - Android Wear is still not a full-fledged android. So there are a few nuances. </p>
<p> So, there are 3 ways to install the program. </p>
<p> <ol>
  <li> 1 method is the simplest. Connect the watch to the computer via a USB cable, open a browser on the PC, go to the Play market and download the application. Complete the installation. If it didn't work, then the program is not supported by the gadget platform. </li>
  <li> Method 2: connect the smart watch to the computer via a USB cable and copy the APK file from it. Then start it from your smartwatch. There are also nuances here: not all gadgets will open a similar format: somewhere it is not supported, somewhere there is a blocking of downloading applications from unknown sources. But this method is safe. </li>
  <li> Method 3 - install the program via a smartphone. To do this, you must first download Wear Apps for Andro> </ol> </p>

<p> Now let's move on to examining the programs themselves. </p>
<h2> Wear Camera Remote: Dedicated to Selfie Lovers </h2>

Moreover, the program works with both the main and the front module. It will come in handy if a large company has gathered, and no one has a selfie stick. But you want a general photo. The Wear camera remote will come to the rescue, just fix the phone, move away so that everyone fits in the photo and press the button from the watch. </p>

<h2> Multi-calculator: convenient calculations </h2>
<p> Another useful smartwatch app is a multi-calculator. If previously such a computer was installed only on a smartphone, now it can be used with a smart watch. For example, a person makes purchases in a store, and he needs to count the amount for which he collected goods. It is offered to count from smart watches. This calculator is one of the most user-friendly thanks to its large numbers and useful functions. </p>
<h2> Wear Internet Browser: a browser adapted for the watch </h2>
<p> Sometimes you need to urgently look at information on the Internet. If the watch works as an autonomous device, but the phone is left at home, then you can find the necessary data from the gadget. </p>
<p> The developers have made a special browser that is adapted for a small screen, it is called the Wear Internet Browser. Difficulties still arise in working with him, because it is rather difficult to get into the miniature letters. But if you get used to it, then a very useful program. </p>

<h1> Smartwatch with high autonomy </h1>
<h2> Offline> 7 days </h2>
<p> - gadgets that can work for more than a week without recharging the battery or changing the battery. </p>
<p> Note that this category includes two types of devices, each with its own characteristics. The first variety is full-featured smartwatches, fitness bracelets and watch phones with capacious batteries and good energy optimization. The autonomy of such models can reach 10-14 days; it should be borne in mind that the characteristics usually take into account the operating time in the conditional "normal mode", at relatively low loads; so if active use is planned, it would not hurt to take a certain margin of autonomy. </p>
<p> The second type of "long-playing" gadgets is ordinary wristwatches (sometimes even with an arrow dial), supplemented by separate "smart" features. Such devices often use coin-cell batteries, such as the CR2032. The term of their autonomy can reach a couple of years, but the functionality is extremely narrow: the mentioned "smart" features are usually limited to notification of calls and messages, less often - a pedometer and some other simple functions. </p>
