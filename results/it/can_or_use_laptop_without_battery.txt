<p> On forums, the question is often raised whether it is possible to turn on a laptop without a battery, and whether it is harmful to use it without a battery. Any battery breaks down over time, and it is not always possible to immediately buy a new one. If you only work with your laptop at home, and do not intend to carry it far from the outlet, it is quite possible to turn it into a stationary PC. You can use it in this mode for many years, while no functions are affected. It is important to properly disconnect the battery and ensure normal storage conditions. </p>
<h2> How do I connect my laptop without battery power? </h2>
<p> The battery is designed for a certain number of charge and discharge cycles, and it is undesirable to keep it on a constant charge up to 100%, as well as to completely discharge it. If you are not using your laptop outside the home, you can take care of the battery safety and disconnect it. At the same time, you cannot store it completely discharged: the charge level should be about 60% so that the capacity does not decrease. It needs to be connected and fully charged and discharged several times a month. </p>
<p> You can turn on your laptop without a battery after a breakdown, if there is no need to buy a new battery. For such a connection, follow these steps: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Turn off the device completely and unplug it. </li>
  <li> Turn the device over and open the battery compartment. On new models, it is fastened with latches, they must be carefully opened. On older models, the cover is held by screws. </li>
  <li> Remove the battery from the case. Some experts recommend keeping it in the refrigerator (but not in the freezer!) To preserve the charge - this way it is guaranteed to be protected from overheating and hypothermia. </li>
  <li> Close the battery compartment, then plug in the power adapter and plug the laptop into a power outlet. After that you can run it and use any programs, it can work on a stationary connection for a very long time. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> An important detail! The battery also performs the function of a voltage stabilizer, so if it is absent, the laptop must be provided with an uninterruptible power supply. This device will help prevent the loss of important data in the event of a sudden power surge or power outage. With an uninterruptible power supply, your laptop will be reliably protected from any unpleasant surprises. </p>

<h2> Peculiarities of using laptop without battery </h2>
<blockquote> <p> Disconnecting the battery for storage does not guarantee full charge retention. The capacity still decreases over time, although the battery does not deteriorate as quickly. Usually up to 20% of capacity is lost in 1-2 years. This can be avoided by periodically inserting the battery into the laptop and performing a training full charge and discharge. In this case, it will last a long time and will always be ready to use. </p> </blockquote>
<p> What should I do if a laptop with a failed battery does not turn on without it? This problem most often occurs if the power supply burns out, as a result of which the device does not work from the mains, and the battery does not charge. Replacing the unit is usually sufficient to clear the charging problems and resume operation with and without battery. </p>
<p> The same problem occurs if the power supply socket is damaged and the laptop is not receiving power. The socket needs to be replaced, after which the device will be ready for use again. Using a laptop without a battery does not deprive the user of any opportunities: you can watch videos, run games, work simultaneously with several applications. If you take care of installing an uninterruptible power supply, your laptop will be provided with a stable and reliable power supply. </p>

<h1> If the laptop does not have a battery, can I use it </h1>
<p> Today you can often find discussion of the issue of laptop operation without a battery. This question worries laptop users for various reasons. Someone motivates this by increasing the battery life, others by recommendations of friends, and still others do it simply because they read about it somewhere. In this article we will try to figure out whether it is necessary and possible to use a laptop without a battery. <br /> <br /> </p>
<h2> Why use a laptop without a battery? </h2>
<p> Indeed, why use a laptop without a battery? When answering this question, users usually say that it saves battery life. Some have seen information that the battery is very vulnerable and has a limited number of charge and discharge cycles. For this reason, they remove the battery from the laptop and work directly from the power adapter connected to the mains. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://akbinfo.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1-26-300x225.jpg" /> </p>
<p> Indeed, in a modern laptop (meaning a normal product of well-known brands, and not a Chinese noname), a battery or mains power circuit is provided. To do this, there is a special microcircuit on the motherboard of the laptop that controls the power. How does it work? </p>
<blockquote> <p> When you plug the power adapter into the laptop's power connector and plug it into a power outlet, the chip turns on the mains power. During this time, the battery is charged if necessary. Moreover, the battery has the same microcircuit for charge and discharge control. </p> </blockquote>
<iframe src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rnBnD7hvyfU?feature=oembed"> </iframe>
<p> This microcircuit is called the BMS battery controller. She is responsible for the process of charging and discharging the battery. When the battery is installed in the laptop and needs to be charged, the BMS board opens access to the lithium cells that make up the battery, and they are charged. At the same time, the board controls the voltage, temperature, and sometimes even the pressure inside the elements. As soon as the parameters go out of range, the BMS controller disconnects the battery from the outside world. This prevents the lithium ion batteries from overheating and catching fire. </p>

<p> Laptop and power adapter </p>
<p> In addition, the microcircuit that controls the power supply on the laptop motherboard automatically switches to mains power mode when the adapter is connected. That is, the battery is excluded from the power supply. If you unplug the adapter, the microcircuit switches to battery mode. <strong> It turns out that the laptop battery acts as an uninterruptible power supply for it. </strong> Thus, in the event of a power outage, you can continue to work from the battery. This is another argument against running a laptop without a battery. </p>
<p> Additionally, we recommend that you read the material about what causes the laptop battery to not charge. </p>

<p> Laptop battery compartment </p>
<p> So, can you use a laptop without a battery? Yes, definitely. But is it necessary? After all, if you use a laptop without a battery, you have to buy an uninterruptible power supply for it. Then, in the event of a power outage, you can save all user files and shutdown gracefully. But think about why you need additional costs. Plus, just because you're going to be using your laptop without a battery doesn't mean you're saving battery. A lithium battery will degrade even when stored. Even if the battery is idle, lithium is destroyed. </p>
<iframe src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/_H_fnTY7ut4?feature=oembed"> </iframe>
<p> Apparently, the myth about saving the battery by turning on the laptop without a battery goes back to the days of alkaline batteries. When laptops first hit the market, their rechargeable batteries used Ni-Cd and Ni-MH cells. As you know, this type of battery has such a disadvantage as "memory effect". The problem is that when a nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal hydride battery is not fully discharged, an electrical double layer is created. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://akbinfo.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4-21-300x225.jpg" /> </p>
<p> Connecting the power adapter to the laptop </p>
<blockquote> <p> This causes the battery to lose some of its capacity. In this case, the voltage decreases slightly, which is perceived as a battery discharge. As a result, the battery starts charging again and the problem gets worse. Therefore, with such a battery, it was reasonable to work from the mains without it. In addition, with alkaline batteries, it was necessary to periodically carry out training, which consisted of a complete discharge and charge of the cells. </p> </blockquote>
<p> But now this type of battery is not used in laptops. Their place was taken by lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries, which do not have a "memory effect". Therefore, I consider it pointless to remove the battery from the laptop. </p>
<h2> How do I turn on my laptop without a battery? </h2>
<p> If you are still not convinced by the reasoning above, let's figure out how to turn on the laptop without a battery. To do this, do the following: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> turn off the laptop if it was turned on. At the same time, make sure that the laptop is turned off, and not gone into sleep mode. That is, the operating system must shut down gracefully; </li>
  <li> unplug the laptop power adapter if it was connected; </li>
  <li> then flip the laptop over and remove the battery. On most modern laptops, the battery case is secured with special clips. In most cases, one fixes after inserting the battery, and the second acts as a latch. These clips are located on the bottom of the laptop. There are laptop models on which the battery is fixed with screws; </li>
  <li> then plug the power adapter into the laptop; </li>
  <li> plug the adapter into a power outlet and turn on the laptop. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2> If the laptop won't turn on without battery </h2>
<p> It is possible that your laptop does not turn on on battery power. Let's take a look at the main reasons for this: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> not working power adapter. Everything is simple here. It is necessary to replace the faulty adapter and connect the laptop; </li>
  <li> the laptop power supply circuit is not designed for this. This is probably the worst option. That is, the laptop is powered only through the battery and nothing else. This can only be found on cheap Chinese fakes; </li>
  <li> laptop motherboard malfunction. The power control IC on the laptop motherboard is not functioning properly. You should already contact the service center with this problem. </li>
</ul>
