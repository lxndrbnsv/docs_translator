<p> More photos here <br /> The first part is not about installing the air conditioner, but about what may happen during the installation process. </p>
<p> Living in a panel house on the top floor is not very comfortable in hot weather. The house heats up during the day and begins to cool down the next morning. The temperature in the apartment is 28+ heat! I decided to install an air conditioner (split-system) myself. <br /> After googling, reading, looking at a lot of information on the Internet, I realized that there was no particular difficulty in installation. Only the problem arose in a special tool, namely, flaring of copper pipes, pipe bender, pipe cutter, vacuum pump. <b> The installation of the air conditioner itself will be in 2 parts! </b> ... </p>
<p> I decided to place the indoor unit of the air conditioner above the sofa under the ceiling, there are simply no other places in the hall! Drill a hole to the outside, screw on the bracket for the indoor unit and the cable channel for the trunk. Everything seems simple, but an air conditioner needs an outlet. I didn't really want to pull the socket in the cable channel along the wall to the floor, or just throw the wire to the air conditioner. Aesthetics after all.) I decided to mess with the installation of an additional outlet near the indoor unit. </p>

<p> Since the repair was completely done by myself, including the electrician, I knew that next to the place where the air conditioner was installed, under the stretch ceiling, there was a line to the outlet behind the sofa. The idea was born: to open the stretch ceiling, cut the cable, put the switchgear. box and branch off the new outlet. Carefully tear off the wallpaper in the corner and make a strobe for the future outlet, then in the cable channel, the one through which the highway will go to the street, stretch the wire and hide the overhead outlet behind the air conditioner. That is, it turns out that the outlet will not be seen when viewed from the side of the front door. </p>
<p> I thought of it on my own head - I started doing it. The ceiling plinth was glued on liquid nails. This skirting board was glued so that when it was torn off, a layer of plaster was torn off. An impressive piece of plaster came off under the wallpaper. He tore off some of the wallpaper and began to remove the fallen plaster. Further more. The chain began to fall off again and again ... </p>

<p> After such troubles, I began to recover. Briefly what has been done. Partial dismantling of stretch ceiling and moldings (special profile). Primer, volma putty in 2 stages, finishing putty with finishing putty), sanding the wall surface. Installation of a junction box, corner chasing and cable outlet for a future socket. Drilling a through hole to the street for the highway. Installation of a baguette, stretching the ceiling. Drilling holes for the air conditioner bracket. Sticking wallpaper and ceiling plinth.

<h1> Guide to installing an air conditioner in an apartment building </h1>
 
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://images.cdn.inmyroom.ru/inmyroom/thumb/980x620/jpg:85/uploads/post/teaser/45/452f/jpg_1000_452f854b-b24c -4e97-8b9b-b1cbc1503925.jpg "/> </p>
<p> This summer we have created a series of articles on air conditioners and will consider all pressing issues: installation of outdoor and outdoor units in apartments, the correct location of the air conditioner in the bedroom and other rooms, as well as, together with experts, we will consider the question of how to make the air conditioner part of the interior and not spoil the design. Stay tuned for updates in the dedicated section! <br /> </p>
<p> In the hot summer, many people start to worry about buying an air conditioner, and then installing it in their apartment. When making a decision, there are several important things to know about installing an air conditioner on the facade of a building. For example, with whom you need to agree (and whether it is necessary at all), who mounts the blocks and how. </p>
<p> Today we will relieve you of doubts and try to figure out how this procedure is performed. </p>
<h2> Determine the location of the indoor unit </h2>
<p> First of all, you determine the place where the future device will hang, most often for the convenience of future repair / dismantling, the air conditioner hangs near the window. A hole is drilled in the wall, which opens onto the facade of the building, and an inter-unit trunk is laid, which will connect the outdoor unit with the indoor device. </p>
<h2> Approval in Moscow </h2>
<p> If you live in Moscow, then coordination with the housing inspection is not required due to the introduction of a new procedure for registering redevelopments from 01.12.2011. Permits for the installation of air conditioners, however, still apply to various historical buildings and architectural monuments. Not all Stalinist houses are considered architectural monuments. If you are an inhabitant of the Stalinka, you can check if your house belongs to the architectural heritage here. </p>
<p> In any case, all work must be carried out in compliance with the current building codes and regulations, and the operation of air conditioners must comply, in particular, with sanitary standards for noise and water disposal (that is, do not threaten the sanitary well-being of the population). Also, communications should not be laid along the facade of the building itself. </p>
<h2> If you live in an ordinary panel house in Moscow, you will not need approval. </h2>
<h2> As for the Moscow region and the regions, it is necessary to show a sketch of the placement of outdoor units on the facade of a residential building and apply for approval from your management company. </h2>
<h2> Approval in the Moscow region and regions </h2>
<p> As for the installation of outdoor units in the Moscow region, here you need to contact the HOA and show the equipment design. There is nothing difficult in this and it will not take much time. You need to complete a sketch of the placement of outdoor units of air conditioners on the facade of a residential building and file an application for approval of the sketch with the management company. The same goes for regions. </p>
<p> There are exceptions in the form of new buildings and glass buildings. In this case, you will need approval from your management company. There, most likely, they will tell you how and in what place you can hang the outdoor unit. </p>
<h2> Editing </h2>
<p> If you install the air conditioner on the ground floor, then you can hang the outdoor unit higher than 1.8-2 meters above the ground and hide it in a special cage. Regardless of the height at which the external unit is fixed, it is necessary to make a metal visor over it. This will protect the device from snow and icicles. </p>
<p> Outdoor units are usually installed by qualified personnel using a ladder. </p>
<p> On high floors, the outdoor unit is mounted from a machine equipped with a sliding ladder. If the installation is carried out above the 5th floor, climbers are called. Such calls are charged separately. If you live on higher floors, then the outdoor unit can be placed on the roof. </p>
<p> We called several companies in Moscow and clarified the cost. On average, the installation and installation of a split system will cost you from 9 to 11 thousand rubles. Climbing services are paid separately - from 2,100 to 3,500 rubles. </p>
