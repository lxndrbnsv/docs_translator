<h1> What happens if you put metal in the microwave </h1>
<p> Microwave oven is by far the fastest and most convenient way to heat and cook food. Almost every owner of this household appliance has at least once come across the fact that some dishes in the microwave begin to sparkle, hiss, melt, or even break. But it is better to do without experimenting and find out what utensils should not be placed in the microwave and why before cooking. </p>

<p> Questions to the microwave </p>
<h2> How a microwave oven works </h2>
<p> Microwave (microwave) oven is an ordinary conductor of microwave electric waves, electromagnetic radiation. It is known from physics that any food consists of atoms and molecules of water and other elements that have both positive and negative charges. The lack of a magnetic field, the charges in the molecules are located freely, chaotically. The powerful magnetic field instantly forms electric charges - they become oriented exactly in according to the direction of the magnetic field lines. </p>
<p> A distinctive feature of microwave radiation is that it flips the dipole molecules not only quickly, but incredibly - almost 5 billion times in one second. Molecules move in accordance with the change in the magnetic field, and the highest rate of "switching" literally creates the effect of friction. Thanks to this property, food in a microwave oven heats up in seconds. </p>

<blockquote> <p> Interesting! Food in a microwave oven heats up in much the same way as palms are heated by quickly rubbing them together. </p> </blockquote>
<h2> Precautions </h2>
<p> <strong> In addition to the fact that the microwave oven is as convenient to use as possible, and even a child can warm up his food, there are still some precautions that must be taken: </strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Do not put dishes with a gold border in the microwave - the spraying can start sparking and lead to the destruction of the dishes; </li>
  <li> The water in a microwave oven heats up very quickly to the boiling point and can leak out, so there is a high probability that water from a container with a narrow neck will simply flow out and can burn your hands. Therefore, be careful not to overheat the liquid; </li>
  <li> Do not reheat whole bird eggs and liquid in a closed container in the microwave. Under the influence of evaporation, a strong pressure is created inside, which can provoke an explosion of a heated object; </li>
  <li> You cannot turn on an empty microwave, there must be at least a glass of water; </li>
  <li> Under no circumstances should metal utensils and metal utensils be placed or heated in the microwave oven, this may lead to unforeseen consequences. </li>

<p> Metal in a microwave oven </p>
<h2> Why you shouldn't put metal in the microwave </h2>
<p> Each instruction included with your microwave oven states that no metal objects should be placed in the oven, as this may result in oven damage or fire. But any person is interested in seeing what will happen if you put metal in the microwave. Many experiments have been carried out using this material and a microwave oven, where it is clearly shown why metal should not be put in the microwave (see video). </p>
<p> <strong> Processes that can occur when heating metal in a microwave oven: </strong> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Metal utensils in the microwave can generate a charge like lightning. This process will at least break the microwave; </li>
  <li> Metal reflects microwaves, so there is a possibility of static discharge. This process is dangerous because it can lead to an explosion. In the best case, you will have to throw out the oven, and in the worst case, you will get health problems; </li>
  <li> Metal in a conventional microwave oven heats up very quickly and can set the oven on fire. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Melting metal in the microwave </h2>
<p> In addition to the dangerous processes that occur when heating metal in a microwave oven, there is also a useful property. For example, in a microwave oven you can easily melt any iron. </p>

<p> The microwave oven works on the same principle as the shadow melting oven. In order to melt the metal in the microwave, you must first remove the rotating plate from it. Next, you need to make a muffle stove from two halves of a heat-resistant brick (see photo), a small recess for the metal is drilled in it. </p>

<h1> Can iron or foil dishes be microwaveable? </h1>
<p> The microwave oven is convenient because it is able to very quickly cook, reheat and defrost various dishes. However, this technique needs careful maintenance. Owners of the device need to pay special attention to the selection of the correct cookware. Can I put iron or foil dishes in the microwave? This issue requires detailed study. </p>
<h2> Metal and Microwave </h2>
<p> It is strictly forbidden to put iron dishes in the microwave. The reflective properties of the metal surface block the passage of microwaves through the container walls, which causes an electrical discharge. If the blow is too strong, the oven mechanism will become unusable. In the most severe cases, an explosion may even occur, since the built-in magnetron cannot cope with the load. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2498919.jpg" /> </p>
<p> When figuring out whether it is possible to put iron dishes in the microwave, the owners of the stove must keep in mind that not only plates and bowls cannot be used. It is also necessary to ensure that no metal spoons, forks, knives get inside. </p>
<p> To the question: "Is it possible to put iron dishes in the microwave?" the answer is unequivocal: "No." Even plates and cups with gold or silver rims create sparking. A discharge of this magnitude cannot damage the oven itself, but ugly dark spots will remain on the plates. </p>
<h2> Microwave and foil wrapped dishes </h2>
<p> It is forbidden to put food wrapped in foil: this also leads to the same result. Owners of microwave ovens should be especially careful and careful when reheating semi-finished products, such as frozen pizza: such food is often packed in aluminum foil. Before sending a treat to the microwave, the packaging must be removed. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2498924.jpg" /> </p>
<p> In some cases, foil is necessary for cooking to prevent individual parts from burning. There is a special microwave foil for such recipes. Such packaging is heat-resistant, its composition differs from ordinary aluminum, therefore it is capable of transmitting microwaves. Often there is perforation in such foil. </p>
<p> It is not recommended to use ordinary food grade aluminum foil instead of special one. In addition to sparking, there is another danger: aluminum does not have sufficient heat resistance, therefore, under the influence of waves, the packaging interacts with food. The metal content in food leads to diseases of the liver, kidneys, and nervous system. If special foil is not available, you can use parchment or a baking sleeve. </p>
<h2> Can I turn on an empty microwave? </h2>
<p> Starting heating in an empty oven is also strictly not recommended. In this case, the microwaves are directed directly into the magnetron, resulting in a breakdown of the part. In addition, the waves are reflected from the inner surfaces and go out through the glass oven door. It is unsafe for people around you. </p>
<h2> The Right Microwave Cookware </h2>
<p> How to choose utensils for the microwave and not be mistaken? Any containers made of heat-resistant glass and heat-resistant plastic are suitable for microwave ovens. Ordinary ceramic cups and plates can also be used to heat food, but it is still not recommended to cook in them: excessive heating may cause the walls to burst and fragments into the food. For the convenience of users, there are special disposable forms made of thick compressed paper. Plastic containers for storing food usually have markings that indicate whether the container can be heated in the oven. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2498929.jpg" /> </p>
<p> The dishes used in the oven must be clean, without greasy splashes or carbon deposits. When heated, the dirt can smoke, which will certainly spoil the quality of the food. You also need to carefully monitor the cleanliness of the inner walls of the microwave in order to maximize the period of its operation. Regularly remove deposits from the inner walls by first disconnecting the device from the power supply. To soften the toughest dirt, pour water into a large container, add 20 grams of baking soda and 20 ml of vinegar. Place the liquid inside the microwave and boil for 3-5 minutes. After that, you can go directly to cleaning. </p>

<p> Now you know if you can put iron dishes in the microwave. Moving away from metal in favor of ceramics, porcelain and plastic will extend the life of your microwave. </p>
