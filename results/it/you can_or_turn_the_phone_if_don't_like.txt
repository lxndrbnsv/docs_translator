<h1> For what reasons and can I return the phone back to the store if I don't like it? </h1>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://info-potrebitel.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/vozvrat0012.jpg" /> </p>
<p> A purchased mobile phone can be frustrating in the first minutes or days of use. An advertisement for a device is triggered, the work of sellers praising a product, or a selling page on the network describing the non-existent advantages of a communication device. No need to worry, it is recommended to return your purchase to the store or exchange it for another device. </p>
<h2> Consumer Protection Law </h2>
<p> When asked whether it is possible to return the phone to the store if you don’t like it, you should first share the reason for dissatisfaction with the purchase. It is one thing when the phone did not live up to expectations, and quite another - if the advertisement of the product objectively lied, instead of the declared characteristics the device does not give out even half. These are different cases, each of which determines the special rights and obligations of the participants in the sale. </p>
<p> Before going to the seller, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the provisions of the Law on Consumer Protection (hereinafter referred to as the Law). If the product is simply not liked, this case is described by Art. 25 Law. </p>
<p> When contacting the seller, you need to present a receipt (cash or sales receipt). Its absence does not mean that the buyer is deprived of the right to exchange. Other evidence will be required to prove that the purchase was made in that store and within two weeks, such as testimony from witnesses, video footage, confirmation from store sellers. </p>
<p> <strong> The following conditions must be met </strong>: </p>
<p> <ol>
  <li> Purchase not used. </li>
  <li> Its presentation has been preserved. </li>
  <li> Consumer properties have not changed. </li>
  <li> Factory seals and labels are not damaged. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> That is, if you apply all this to the phone, then you can hand it over before you start using it. We literally opened the box, turned it on, looked at it, checked the performance, the video camera, the sound. If, after the demonstration, any of the above parameters is not satisfied, you can change it. In the case when the device was used, it will be more difficult to exchange the phone. </p>
<p> Can I return my phone to the store if I don't like it? <strong> The law also provides for another reason for returning the phone - deficiencies have been identified in it </strong> (Article 18). In this case, the buyer may request: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Exchange device; </li>
  <li> Reduce purchase price; </li>
  <li> Refunds for it. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> The store has the right to immediately satisfy the consumer's demand or send the phone number for examination beforehand. Based on its results, the seller is determined with a decision - to satisfy or refuse the applicant, to find a compromise option. </p>
<p> Another feature that should be taken into account is that the <strong> legislator has defined a list of those items that cannot be returned after purchase </strong>. This also applies to technically complex devices. In judicial practice, there is an ambiguous attitude about whether a phone should be considered such a device or not. </p>
<p> Therefore, before filing a claim, it is recommended that you consult with your local lawyer regarding the practice of returning your phone back to the store. In many cases, practicing lawyers agree that phones are included in this list, so you can return money or exchange a phone only because of a device defect or at the discretion of the seller. </p>
<h3> Refunds without good reason </h3>
<p> The above article 25 of the Law provides the reasons why you can return the phone to the store. In accordance with this rule, <strong> purchase exchange is possible if </strong>: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Not satisfied with its shape and dimensions; </li>
  <li> Don't like her style and colors; </li>
  <li> Not fit or size. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> These criteria are quite subjective, for any phone, even the latest model of a renowned manufacturer, you can indicate that its shapes are ugly, and the color does not match the case or clothing. Therefore, the buyer has a formal reason to return the phone, hiding behind one of the above reasons. </p>
<p> <strong> But this is only suitable in those regions in which the courts do not classify phones as technically complex devices </strong>, consider the buyer's requirements for an exchange fair. In addition, in the case of a purchase through an online store, the Law provides for the return of any non-food item without a valid reason. The main requirement is to meet the deadlines for contacting the store. </p>
<p> Another technique that can be used in combination with the previous one or on its own is to check the device by IMEI. As a result, it may turn out that the purchased phone is counterfeit, namely: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> It does not exist in the database; </li>
  <li> This device is not intended for use in Russia. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> Based on these data, you should contact the seller and demand a refund. Here it is necessary to be guided by Art. 8-10, 12 of the Law, the provisions of which indicate that the buyer must be informed about: </p>
<p> <ol>
  <li> Device manufacturer. </li>
  <li> Main consumer properties of the purchase. </li>
  <li> Its warranty period. </li>
  <li> Other important information. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> If the phone is not intended for use in the Russian Federation, this may create problems in the future. For example, services will refuse to take such a device for service, carry out warranty repairs. </p>
<p> If checked by IMEI, it may turn out that the phone is not counterfeit. Then you should resort to another trick - pay attention to the instructions for the phone. Often it is written in a foreign language without Russian translation, or it is made formally on one or two pages. This can be used as an argument about the lack of complete information about the device, gives reason to return the phone back to the store. </p>
<h3> The next day </h3>
<p> To understand whether you liked the purchase or not, just a few minutes or hours. The next day, the buyer must decide what he needs - to return the money or exchange the phone for another, and based on the analysis of the provisions of the Law - whether it is possible to return the phone to the store if he didn’t like it. If we proceed from the fact that the purchase belongs to technically complex devices (in all honesty, this is the case, the position of some ships that think otherwise is surprising), <strong> will have to ask the seller. The arguments are all the same as above </strong>. </p>
<p> From when exactly they applied - in a day or a week, the situation does not change significantly. A working phone can be changed or refunded for it only at the discretion of the seller. Another option is to establish that counterfeit products were purchased or to prove a violation of the provisions of Art. 8-10, 12 of the Law (failure to provide information). </p>
<h2> Procedure for handing over the purchased item </h2>
<p> As in all cases of conflict resolution between the seller and the buyer <strong>, pre-trial and judicial settlement of the issue </strong> is provided. In the first case, you have to talk directly with the seller. The task is to convince you to return the money or exchange the phone, or find a compromise option. </p>
<p> Arguments to return can be: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> Loyal customer; </li>
  <li> The phone is not exactly the one we talked about when buying; </li>
  <li> Parameters do not match. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> If we are talking about identified shortcomings, defects, you need to indicate them. In small stores, the conversation is conducted directly with the seller and there is a high probability of rejection. In retail chains, it is recommended to talk with managers, administrators, and not with ordinary staff. There are more chances of granting the request. </p>
<h3> If they refuse to give money </h3>
<p> In cases where the buyer needs money back, he does not claim an exchange, <strong> it is necessary to prove the validity of the claim. For this </strong>: </p>
<p> <ol>
  <li> The documentation for the phone is being checked - to justify the claims for a refund, it must be in a foreign language or a small Russified instruction (and not a standard booklet). </li>
  <li> The phone's IMEI is determined to detect counterfeit products. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> You can determine the IMEI through online services that are suitable for checking different brands of smartphones and push-button phones. You need to enter the serial number of the device. Its absence in the database gives the right to claim that it is counterfeit. </p>
<p> Both methods allow you to get grounds for a refund within 5-10 minutes. After that, a claim is drawn up (written in free form) and sent to the store. It can be sent by mail in a valuable letter or handed over to the seller against signature with the date of receipt stamped on the second copy. The second option is recommended, because at the same time you need to hand over the phone itself according to the acceptance certificate.
<p> After receiving a claim, the seller has 10 days to respond. <strong> If he refuses to comply, you can file a complaint </strong>: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> To Rospotrebnadzor; </li>
  <li> To the consumer protection authority under the local administration; </li>
  <li> To the prosecutor's office. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> The first two organizations are directly involved in restoring the rights of citizens as consumers. But the prosecutor's office will be interested in the appearance of counterfeit products. Additionally, you can contact the customs authorities in this regard. In parallel, you can notify the seller with copies of appeals to the regulatory authorities. This stimulates him to find a compromise solution or satisfy the demand for a refund for the phone. </p>
<p> If the complaints have not brought the expected effect, it remains to go to court. There is no need to pay the state duty, the plaintiff risks losing only time. The main emphasis in the claim should be made on the fact that the consumer's rights to information were violated or a counterfeit product was sold. </p>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p> When buying a phone, it is recommended that you first familiarize yourself with video reviews about it, as well as customer reviews. And only after a clear understanding of what you are buying, you pay money for the product. In this case, a refund will be required due to a discovered defect, malfunction, which sharply increases the chances of a refund. </p>

<h1> The procedure for returning a purchased phone to the store if it is not pleasant or broken </h1>
<p> If the device does not fit in terms of external parameters or functionality, or if there are malfunctions, you can return the phone to the store. The Law "On Protection of Consumer Rights" clarifies whether it is possible to return the device if it is not pleasant, how long after the purchase, is a check required. </p>
<p> How to get the money back for the phone depends on the reasons: the device turned out to be of poor quality or didn't like it. But to transfer money, you must write a statement indicating the account details. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://zpp.guru/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/23-750x502.jpg" /> </p>
<p> The return of a phone of inadequate quality is made taking into account the circumstances: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> for a device with defects, the buyer receives money back, and has the right to claim compensation for losses incurred; </li>
  <li> phone refunds require a passport; </li>
  <li> check is desirable, but not required. If the buyer arrives without a receipt, he will need to use the evidence. In addition, all stores are equipped with cameras, so it's easy to prove the purchase; </li>
  <li> you can return a broken phone during the warranty period; </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://zpp.guru/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/21-750x354.jpg" /> </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> in the event of a disagreement on the reasons for the appearance of defects, the seller assigns an expert study; </li>
  <li> the buyer can be in the research - this is his right; </li>
  <li> if the defects are the result of mishandling, the buyer will reimburse the costs incurred by the store; </li>
  <li> the buyer has the right to conduct his own expertise and challenge the seller's refusal in court; </li>
  <li> if the warranty period is not set, it is considered equal to 2 years; </li>
  <li> The store must return the money for the defective phone 10 days in advance. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://zpp.guru/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1-4-750x734.jpg" /> </p>
<h2> Technically complex product </h2>
<p> The law stipulates that the customer returns the phone to the store in 15 days (one day less for ordinary things) Then it is permissible to give the smartphone to the store when: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> a significant defect has appeared or was discovered (preventing the use of the product for its intended purpose); </li>
  <li> the repair time exceeds 45 days; </li>
  <li> the item has not been used for a month within one year of warranty due to repairs. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> You can get money back for a defective phone that is classified as a difficult thing. The term for transferring funds is standard - 10 days. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://zpp.guru/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ZoZPP-18-750x813.png" /> </p>
<h2> How to return a quality device </h2>
<p> Gadget lovers are often interested in whether it is possible to return the phone within 14 days without explaining the reasons, like clothes, and what to do if the device is not liked. The return of a mobile phone without defects and defects is made according to the general procedure. It is allowed to return the phone if the following conditions are met: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> visit the store within 14 days; </li>
  <li> the device has not been used, has no corresponding traces. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://zpp.guru/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ZoZPP-25-750x729.png" /> </p>
<p> You can return the phone by agreement with the seller. It is much easier to negotiate the exchange of a new phone for another model or brand at a surcharge if there is a difference in cost. Making an exchange for a store is easier than canceling the deal entirely. </p>
<p> It is recommended to negotiate not with sellers, but with those who make decisions, for example, a director. It is easier to return or exchange a device in online stores without a receipt than in small retail outlets or online stores. </p>
<p> <iframe src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/IIfjk00P3fY"> </iframe> </p>
<p> When the seller refuses to exchange and return, it is recommended to proceed to written communication, that is, write a claim for a refund for the phone, explaining the situation and the reasons for contacting.
<p> According to the Law of the Russian Federation "On Protection of Consumer Rights", the phone is returned if the store on the day of purchase for some reason did not provide the buyer with full information. This fact is proved by testimony, friends or acquaintances. </p>
<p> If a short instruction was attached to the device, instead of a full one, or it was not in Russian, the store violated the provisions of the ZOZPP - this is the basis for returning the cell phone. </p>

<p> Since a cell phone <strong> is a technically complex product </strong> and is included in this list of goods, it cannot be returned back to the store or exchanged, even if 14 days have not passed, and even if it is functional. </ p>
<p> Not satisfied with the color, inconvenient to hold, not satisfied with the model, just tired - the phone can be exchanged as an exception, but only within two weeks. </p>
<p> After a two-week period, the seller will refuse to exchange or return the phone to the consumer according to the law. </p>

<p> <ul>
  <li> Refunds are made within <strong> 14 days </strong> after purchasing the item; </li>
  <li> The Buyer, using a <strong> examination </strong>, proved that the phone is defective due to the fault of the sold party (if there is no warranty card, and if available, the seller must prove the unlawfulness of the buyer's claims).

<h2> If the product was purchased through an online store? </h2>

<blockquote> <p> Read also in our article if it is possible to return to the store bed linen, which for some reason did not fit. </p> </blockquote>
<p> <strong> When exchanging </strong> a product for another seller, this procedure must be completed within 7 days. When carrying out an additional check of the quality of the phone, this procedure is given 20 days. </p>

<p> First, you need to <strong> meet the deadlines </strong> of contacting the store with a request to return or exchange a cell phone (i.e. within 14 days after payment). </p>
<p> Then the procedure for the return or exchange will be faster than missing the deadline for requesting a return or exchange of goods. </p>
<p> We can say that the seller did not provide proper and complete information about the product. </p>
<p> In addition, you can refer to the <strong> lack of detailed instructions </strong> for the cell phone (since often only a brief guide is attached to it), and as a result, not providing comprehensive information about the functions and capabilities of the phone. </ p >
<p> You can also offer a <strong> exchange of goods </strong>, since the store is more willing to exchange goods than to a refund. When exchanging goods for another, less expensive, the buyer is paid the difference, and in the case when the selected item for exchange costs more, the buyer will have to pay the difference. </p>
<blockquote> <p> Also in our article you can find out if it is possible to return goods within 14 days by law without giving any reason. </p> </blockquote>
<h2> What if the seller breaks the law? </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://zakonpotr.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sud-300x200.jpg" /> </p>
<p> If the examination confirms a factory defect, but the seller refuses to return or exchange the phone, the buyer needs to write a <strong> claim </strong>, indicating in it: full name. the buyer and his contact details, the full name of the goods, the requirement clearly formulated by the buyer (for exchange or return), the reason for the exchange or return, the date of writing the claim, signature. A copy of the sales receipt is attached to the claim. </p>
<p> The copy of the buyer's claim must be signed by the seller's representative. </p>
<p> The claim is considered within <strong> 10 days </strong>, after which the store will respond to it. If a decision is made in favor of the buyer, the money is returned to him under the guarantee for the product, or an exchange is made for another product. </p>
<p> If a decision is made to refuse to satisfy the buyer's claim, he can apply to <strong> Rospotrebnadzor </strong> with this paper. If, in this case, a refusal to return or exchange a cell phone follows, the consumer has the right to go to court. </p>
<p> A claim form for a refund for a defective product can be downloaded from this link. </p>
<p> If the seller refused to voluntarily satisfy the buyer's claims, he will be subject to the liability stipulated in Article 13 of the Law "On Protection of Consumer Rights". </p>
