<h1> The best online PC games with friends </h1>
<p> Any multiplayer game only gets better when played with friends. And even if you are in different cities, and cannot visit each other to participate in co-op adventures in split-screen or throw fun parties with games, there are still projects that will help you team up. We will tell you about them in this collection. </p>
<h2> Online games with friends </h2>
<p> Twenty best, in our opinion, online games that are perfect for a large company (four or more people). </p>
<h2> Monster Hunter: World </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> Number of players: 4 </p>
<p> In this co-op action RPG, you have to hunt down and conquer numerous fantasy creatures, the fruit of the imagination of Japanese game makers from Capcom. The essence of the game lies in endless grind: you will kill monsters to get resources, to create equipment, to kill even more powerful monsters - and so on ad infinitum. The developers are constantly updating the game with fresh content, including unusual collaborations, such as an add-on with characters and monsters from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. </p>
<h2> Borderlands 2 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> In general, all games in the Borderlands series are good, but for this collection we decided to focus on the second part, as the most ambitious, rich and exciting. This title is likely to go to Borderlands 3 in the future (when the game is overgrown with additions), but for now it still remains with the sequel. Borderlands 2 is a co-op looter shooter with mountains of weapons, tens of thousands of opponents and great black humor. </p>
<h2> Rainbow Six Siege </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> In the online shooter Rainbow Six Siege, you can form a team with friends and fight against other players in intense competitive matches, as well as fight off waves of bots in cooperative mode. In any case, the game will give you a lot of positive impressions due to well-thought-out tactical gameplay. </p>
<h2> Don’t Starve Together </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> This survival simulator invites players to fight the horrors of a nightmarish otherworldly world where anything can kill characters - from cold and hunger to monsters and mental disorders. The original game was aimed at solo survival, while the expansion (which does not require Don’t Starve) allows you to play online with friends - which, however, does not increase the chances of winning. </p>
<h2> Destiny 2 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> The popular shooter Destiny 2 was originally designed for cooperative gameplay, so it's great for a group of friends. Here you will find an exciting plot, a large selection of character classes and weapons, as well as numerous missions, raids, tasks, and so on. The developers announced that in September 2019 the base part of the game will be completely free, so you can freely download it on Steam and join the adventure. Well, if you like everything, support the authors with a ruble by purchasing add-ons with new content. </p>
<h2> Divinity: Original Sin 2 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> D: OS2 is a unique RPG. It can be played by four, but it does not represent another diabloid with endless battles. On the contrary, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a true CRPG with detailed characters, branched dialogue and complete freedom of choice. And here the developers managed to implement a gameplay in which each player will become a full-fledged hero and will be able to move the plot together with their partners - or embark on their own journey, separating from the group. </p>
<h2> Warhammer: Vermintide 2 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> This cooperative action RPG will take you to a dark fantasy world where you and your friends have to survive, destroying thousands of monsters, collecting valuable loot and pumping your characters. Warhammer: Vermintide 2 focuses on interaction between players, so it is advisable to acquire trusted allies for joint passage - playing with random can greatly spoil the experience of the gameplay. </p>
<h2> Grim Dawn </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> A curious hack'n'slash in the spirit of Diablo and Titan Quest allows players to gather a company to clear locations from various monsters - of course, in the name of saving the world. In addition to constant battles, the game also has a huge selection of skills and perks, a system for crafting equipment, building character builds and a lot of quests. </p>
<h2> World War Z </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> Based on the movie of the same name, the game will take you on a journey to the largest cities in the world, including Moscow and New York, where you have to face hordes of the living dead. The zombie shooter from Saber Interactive turned out to be very good, and the only thing that overshadows it is the absence on Steam. Otherwise, this is more than a worthy option for spending time together. </p>
<h2> Sea of ​​Thieves </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> Sea of ​​Thieves is an MMO action game about pirates that perfectly captures the spirit of adventure and requires perfect teamwork. The ship will not go out to sea if the crew does not learn how to set sails and plot a course, and will quickly sink in the first skirmish, if the sailors do not fire their cannons and bail water out of the hold. But well-coordinated work will certainly be rewarded with mountains of treasures. </p>
<h2> The Division 2 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> In Ubisoft's post-apocalyptic RPG, you'll explore a world that has fallen into chaos after a devastating terrorist attack. And here reliable friends will be more than appropriate: a loner will not withstand marauders, bandits and fanatics for a long time, and raids are even more designed only for joint passage. Teamwork is emphasized and specializations that allow players to play different roles in the squad, complementing each other. </p>
<h2> Left 4 Dead 2 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> This zombie shooter was released a long time ago, due to which it is ideal for owners of weak PCs. You and your friends are waiting for cooperative races in various locations and battles with zombie hordes led by an AI director who simulates game situations based on the state of the main characters. If you get tired of saving yourself from monsters, you can side with them and hunt the survivors. Thanks to this, as well as the huge number of cards in the Workshop, the game can boast almost endless replayability. </p>
<h2> Broforce </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> A killer cooperative 2D shooter with completely destructible environments, a huge selection of brutal characters from classic action movies and impressive bosses. Broforce will draw you in with an exciting story campaign, give you the opportunity to have a lot of fun in PvP Deathmatch mode, and also offer you to show a creative touch in the custom level editor. You can also download new missions and entire campaigns from the Workshop to continue your adventure even after completing the campaign. </p>
<h2> Forza Horizon 4 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> A part of England open for exploration, more than 450 cars with tuning and customization, flexible adjustment of difficulty from arcade to almost-car simulator, regular change of seasons - what else is needed for a good racing game? Perhaps only the ability to race with friends in a variety of competitive modes with customizable rules. All of the above is in Forza Horizon 4 - arguably the best arcade racing game today. </p>
<h2> Warframe </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> Warframe is an example of how a free game can be successful without emptying players' wallets. Yes, there is donation here, as in any other free-to-play game, but you can bend down here without financial investment. Well, the joint missions here are worthy of all praise. If you are loyal to grinding in games, Warframe will be the best (and most importantly, free) entertainment for your company. </p>
<h2> State of Decay 2 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> Fans of the zombie action State of Decay asked the developers to add a co-op to the sequel, and they listened to the requests. Together with your friends, you can start building a base, explore the world in search of resources and survivors willing to join your settlement, and, of course, fight the undead. </p>
<h2> Ghost Recon Wildlands </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> Ghost Recon Wildlands invites players to free sunny Bolivia from the drug cartel settled there. A huge world, a large selection of weapons and three faithful partners next to you - what more could you want? The tactical shooter gives you complete freedom of action and choice of ways to complete missions, so you can experiment by sneaking into the enemy base or storming it using all available guns. Ubisoft is already preparing a sequel to the game: you will not be left without adventure. </p>
<h2> Mordhau </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> This action was a hit on Steam, selling over a million copies in its first month after release, which is great for early access. Here you can assemble a team with friends and fight against AI opponents in the co-op Horde mode, or go to competitive multiplayer, where large-scale castle siege battles are implemented. As for the gameplay, it will delight you with a good balance between realism and dynamics, where you are in complete control of your character. Well, one cannot but mention the blood and dismemberment - any action in the medieval setting would be incomplete without these elements. </p>
<h2> Magicka 2 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> Co-op, magic and humor - these three elephants are the basis for the gameplay of the exciting action game Magicka 2. You will travel through fantasy lands, where you will meet unusual characters and fight hilarious monsters. The game is distinguished by an unusual combat system: there are no knights and archers, and the mages playing the main roles use various elemental spells and their combinations (which you will have to invent yourself). Add non-switchable friendly fire to this and you have a chaotic but very fun game for a group of friends! </p>
<h2> Torchlight 2 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> The diabloid closes our top twenty, who got as close as possible to his ideological mastermind: the game drags on with endless battles, the constant search for loot in the inventory, a variety of monsters and interesting pumping of characters. And support for the Steam Workshop makes it possible to extend the adventure even when the content of the main game is completed "from and to". </p>
<h2> Online play with a friend </h2>
<p> Ten good duo games. </p>
<h2> A Way Out </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> Perhaps the best adventure game with a friend over the network or on the same computer. The developers have created an action game that cannot be completed alone: ​​the AI ​​does not take on the role of a partner, so you will have to look for a living partner to solve puzzles and participate in shootouts. But it's worth it: A Way Out immerses you in the atmosphere of a road trip, gives genuine emotions and leaves a pleasant aftertaste after the end credits. </p>
<h2> Resident Evil 5 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> The Resident Evil series needs no introduction: for several decades now, its games have told us the story of the struggle against sinister corporations that produce bio-weapons. The fifth part of the lineup has become one of the best - not least thanks to a high-quality co-op for two, where players not only fight zombies, but act as one team, covering each other in battles and solving puzzles. </p>
<h2> Portal 2 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> Portal 2 is a great solo adventure with charismatic characters, hilarious humor and moderately challenging puzzles. And it's also a gorgeous cooperative adventure: the joint campaign turned out to be no worse than the single-coded one, and the levels designed for pairing will make the players think hard about solving local problems. Valve has even taken care of those who play with each other for the first time: the gesture system allows you to understand your partner without words. </p>
<h2> Conan Unconquered </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> In this relatively fresh strategy from Funcom, you and a friend have to fight off waves of advancing enemies, dividing the same fortress for two. The number of monsters is incalculable, but you also have something to oppose to them: the game has a large selection of military units, defense towers and traps, an extensive tree of technologies, as well as the ability to call for help a divine avatar, capable of dealing with any threat in a matter of minutes. < / p>
<h2> Human: Fall Flat </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> A physics-based puzzle game that encourages creativity in solving problems. On each map (the whole game is, in fact, a set of locations unrelated to the plot), the participants are given complete freedom of action: one and the same obstacle can be climbed, bypassed, destroyed, and so on. The main characters give a special charm to the game - clumsy, slow, but very charming little people, whose ridiculous falls will make you burst out laughing more than once. </p>
<h2> Far Cry 5 </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> By the fifth part, the Far Cry series finally took shape in a "sandbox" where players can create whatever they want. Co-op was also allowed in previous installments of the franchise, but only in Far Cry 5 was the formula perfected: you can go through the story campaign with a friend, and when you get tired of completing missions - have fun in the open world, fighting endless crowds of religious fanatics from the American hinterland. Well, to do this as efficiently (and effectively) as possible will help you with a huge selection of weapons and vehicles. </p>
<h2> Fade to Silence </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> In this action RPG you have to survive in a world frozen as a result of a global catastrophe. Fade to Silence is interesting not so much for its crafting and construction systems, not so much for fighting in the spirit of Dark Souls with local monsters, and not so much for cleansing the world from otherworldly infection, but for its stunning winter atmosphere that perfectly conveys the deadly charm of the icy desert. Of course, it is better to fight demons and ride wolf sleds in the company of a faithful partner, so call a friend and go to conquer the post-apocalyptic world. </p>
<h2> Outward </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> A hardcore RPG with local and online co-op in which you will explore the fantasy world, facing many dangers in the face of aggressive monsters, disease, hunger and thirst, cold and so on. Surviving here isn't easy, but teamwork is likely to improve your chances of success. </p>
<h2> Ashen </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> Another hardcore role-playing action game that offers to explore gloomy locations filled with creepy monsters - all in order to find a new home for the main character and his people. By teaming up with a friend, you will be able to more effectively fight enemies and overcome all kinds of difficulties. Which obviously will not be superfluous, because the project has a high complexity, comparable to the games of the Dark Souls series. </p>
<h2> Wolfenstein: Youngblood </h2>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://cubiq.ru/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" /> </p>
<p> The last game was given a place in our selection in advance, because at the time of this writing, it has not yet been released. Nevertheless, there is no reason to doubt its quality: MachineGames (Wolfenstein: The New Order) and Arkane Studios (Dishonored, Prey) are engaged in development - the first team is responsible for shooting, the second is working on creating branched locations and narration. Youngblood is a whirlwind co-op shooter set in an alternative 80s setting, where the daughters of B.J. Blaskowitz deal with the Nazis in every way they can, using a huge arsenal of weapons and unique abilities. </p>
