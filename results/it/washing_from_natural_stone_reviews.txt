<p> Hello dear friends! Has anyone else, I wonder, wondered about buying a kitchen sink like me? Oh-oh-oh, the choice is enormous, my friends. And you know what? Artificial stone sinks! - the reviews decided for me. Although they do not install anything: ceramic sinks, cast iron, stainless steel, tempered glass, stone, wooden! A detailed study of the issue below. </p>
<h2> Main characteristics of a sink made of artificial stone </h2>
<p> It was nice to find out that artificial stone is only 20% artificial. It turns out that this is a composite, which contains 80% of natural stone chips (marble, granite), and the rest is a connecting polymer link (resins, dyes, protective compounds to increase strength). This stone is also called "casting" because the sinks are cast using a special vibrocasting technology. Thanks to this, you can order a sink of any shape, type, size, color. It will have a uniform structure, reliable and resistant to various kitchen pests. </p>

<p> The most common shells are black, beige, white. The textures are very similar to natural stone to the touch and pattern. But you can choose any color you like: from pink with red to light green. Moreover, the color, people write, is the same in 10 years. Or you can embellish the top with something else: make it look like an antique surface, leather, glossy or, on the contrary, matte. </p>
<p> An important feature for me is unpretentious care. In addition, they are resistant to chemical attack and can withstand temperature drops from +150 to -30 degrees Celsius. What happens if you pour boiling water into a ceramic sink sharply? I will say: with a certain degree of probability, it will crack. According to customer reviews, the surface of their sinks was not spoiled even by poured hydrogen peroxide, ammonia, various types of acids, to say nothing of ordinary household chemicals. </p>
<h3> Pros of a sink made of artificial stone </h3>
<p> In general, having studied the numerous information, I would like to summarize and highlight all the positives of these sinks: </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://vmk-mebel.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kamennaya-moyka-vblizi-e1515605652381.jpg" /> </ p >
<p> <ul>
  <li> Service life. Very long lasting, at least 10 years for most manufacturers. Of course, a sink made of natural stone would have made my choice, but here comes a new plus. </li>
  <li> Price. It is relatively low. Of course, if you compare with the cost, for example, stainless steel or enameled sinks, the latter will benefit. But what will happen to these sinks in a year? Scratches, plaque, faded color - and they already look as if you did not wash them at all. Therefore, the price in terms of price / quality is more than optimal. </li>
  <li> Hygiene. Manufacturers claim that the artificial stone used for the manufacture of sinks does not give rise to pathogenic bacteria and microorganisms, so there is no plaque or unpleasant odors on the surface. </li>
  <li> Possibility of self-repair. If in some way there are scratches or other defects - just clean this place with sandpaper, polish and that's it. And a case was also described on the forum: a piece broke off, glued back with ordinary acrylic glue, not even a hint remained. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3> Cons of artificial stone sinks </h3>
<p> There are not many of them, but they are. Although high temperatures are not dangerous, if you put the pan straight off the stove, it will most likely leave a trace. Also, from a strong blow (they dropped something, missed the meat with a hatchet), a crack and a chip will appear. This is rare, but it happens. It's good that you can fix the damage yourself. </p>
<h2> Built in worktop </h2>
<p> There are sinks that are built into the countertop. They are made of the same material as the table top, the joints are covered with a special glue of the same color. As a result, we have an absolutely solid-looking, monolithic surface. This integrated sink looks very cool. But it also has pros and cons. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://vmk-mebel.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kamennaya-moyka-vkleennaya-e1515605769474.jpg" /> </ p >
<p> Of the pros - this is undoubtedly the appearance. In any case, in the photo, everything looks as if both the countertop and the sink are a single whole, completely not standing out in color. No seams, edges, sides. You can, as they say, wipe the entire surface at a time with a light wave of your hand, and there is no accumulation of dirt in any cracks. It's very convenient. </p>
<p> Of the minuses, manufacturers note the undesirable installation of the grinder. Because the vibration can creep the seams. But how many have grinders in our kitchens? If the sink looks like it cannot be restored, it is likely that the entire structure with the countertop will have to be completely changed, because it will be difficult to re-select the color-to-color. </p>
<p> Still, integrated sinks are very popular, especially for bathrooms, where the likelihood of damage is minimal. </p>

<h2> Manufacturer selection </h2>
<p> Choosing a sink, you can be surprised by the range of prices and terms of sale: guarantees, delivery, installation. You need to approach these points meticulously: find the manufacturer's website, compare all the proposed options. Granfest is now offering an interesting range of German quartz. They also presented the new GranFest-ECO line, although before that they had declared their safe and environmentally friendly. An extremely large selection of Blanco sinks. BLANCO is a renowned German manufacturer of premium kitchen sinks and accessories. The well-known Moscow company Polygran is an excellent alternative to foreign analogues: reasonable prices and quality at the level. </p>
<p> For this I say goodbye to you, friends! Come again, bring your friends! I'm interested here! </p>

<h1> Stone sink for the kitchen: reviews, pros and cons. Artificial stone kitchen sinks </h1>
<p> An elite kitchen interior seems unfinished if it is not complemented by a double stone sink for the kitchen. The advantage of such a sink lies in its functionality, high-quality performance and appearance. </p>
<p> Artificial stone is a derived material for sanitary ware of various shapes and purposes, including kitchen sinks. At first glance, it is rather difficult to distinguish it from natural, which cannot be ignored when creating an exquisite and rich interior of a room. The advantages of such a material provide an unprecedented demand for products made from it. But what has earned the popularity of a stone sink for the kitchen? Reviews on the Internet are very controversial, so let's try to figure it out. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45292/1714327.jpg" /> </p>
<h2> What challenges do you face? </h2>
<p> The purchase of any product is accompanied by various concerns from the consumer. The manufacturer can guarantee the quality of his product, but its improper use can lead to a rapid loss of aesthetic appearance or micro-damage to the sink. A stone sink for the kitchen, the pros and cons of which are due to the characteristics of the material from which it is made, can become an interior decoration, or it can completely ruin the picture if you choose it wrong. </p>
<p> Sometimes the consumer is faced with problems related to the correct operation of the kitchen sink. Let's talk about them and try to determine the cause of their occurrence. </p>
<h2> Spots appearing </h2>
<p> Kitchen sinks made of artificial stone react to temperature changes. So, putting hot dishes on a dark sink, you risk ruining the appearance of the latter. A light spot may form where the object touches the surface. </p>
<p> Over time, dark spots may appear on light stone shells from interaction with acids found in wine, juices, beets. Even regular coffee can be harmful. </p>
<h2> Mechanical damage </h2>
<p> A sink can be cracked when its surface comes into contact with excessively hot water. Therefore, when installing corner stone sinks for the kitchen or traditional models in the kitchen, you should study their features and try to treat such structures with care. </p>
<p> Sink splits, chips or cracks can be caused by accidentally dropping heavy dishes. </p>
<h2> Care Rules </h2>
<p> You will have to wash and clean the kitchen sink daily. Artificial stone is a finicky material that requires careful maintenance. </p>
<p> The absence of drops and water deposits on a sink made of artificial stone does not mean at all that the kitchen structure does not need to be maintained. </p>
<p> Since the first use: </p>
<p> <ul>
  <li> rinse and dry the sink; </li>
  <li> use a special tool to handle it; some models of stone sinks for the kitchen use a special antibacterial composition; </li>
  <li> regularly clean the sink from deposits; </li>
  <li> only place hot stainless steel cookware in the sink on a rubber, silicone or cork mat; </li>
  <li> remember to turn on the hot water faucet before pouring boiling water into the sink. This will prevent deposits and rapid wear on the siphon. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45292/1714329.jpg" /> </p>
<h2> Aesthetic component </h2>
<p> Some types of artificial stone look so cheap that outwardly and closely do not resemble an imitation of natural material or granite, but, on the contrary, look like plastic. </p>
<p> The quality of the sink depends on the production composition: the cheaper it is, the worse the stone sink looks for the kitchen. Testimonials from potential buyers illustrate this trend. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45292/1714333.jpg" /> </p>
<p> All of the above problems are not the result of poor quality production. They are caused by improper care or non-functional use of the sink. You can avoid such troubles, the main thing is to make the right choice in the process of purchasing a kitchen sink. </p>
<h2> Interesting about kitchen sinks </h2>
<p> On the Internet, they often mention the troubles inherent in sinks made of artificial stone: the bottom fell off, the sink cracked, spots of an incomprehensible nature appeared. When faced with this information, try to figure it out. </p>
<p> In most cases, this happens with acrylic sinks integrated into the countertop. Inset composite kitchen sinks made of artificial stone, made of marble or granite, are more resistant to high temperatures and mechanical factors. Therefore, when choosing a sink for the kitchen, it is better to give preference to just such materials. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45292/1714346.jpg" /> </p>
<p> Sink made of granite is not afraid of acids. Stains rarely form on it, and if they do, you can get rid of them with a regular detergent and a sponge for washing dishes. </p>
<p> Chips or cracks on granite sinks are formed due to manufacturing defects or when purchasing a fake. </p>
<p> Most often, problems with acrylic sinks arise from the use of cheap raw materials imported from China that do not meet the EU quality standard. Иногда нарушение технологии производства кухонной столешницы также приводит к сокращению срока службы мойки</p>
<h2>Особенности раковин из акрилового камня</h2>
<p>Раковины, изготовленные из акрилового камня, легко отличить от врезных моделей, в основе которых - гранит. Популярностью пользуются интегрированные виды моек для кухни.</p>
<p style="clear: both"><img src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45292/1714354.jpg" /></p>
<p>Мойка, изготовленная из акрилового камня, по прочности не сравнится с изделиями из искусственного гранита. Зато такой материал легче обработать и отшлифовать в процессе производства. Из акрила можно сделать раковину для кухонной мойки любой формы и монтировать ее в столешницу так, что граница между ней и рабочей поверхностью последней не будет заметна.</p>
<p>Но несмотря на то, что эстетически конструкция выглядит гармонично, как единое целое, шов все-таки имеется. Встречаются случаи, когда шов раскрывается от сильного удара, резкого перепада температур, вибрации либо при некачественной врезке мойки в столешницу, обусловленной использованием плохого клея и герметика, нарушением технологии производства.</p>
<p>Существует возможность заказа цельнолитой конструкции: мойки и рабочей кухонной поверхности. Кроме этого вы можете выбрать любые размеры каменной мойки для кухни и сделать ее на заказ.</p>
<p>Относясь к акрилу внимательнее, ухаживая за ним и тщательнее выбирая производителя, вы сможете найти такую мойку, которую будете использовать по функциональному предназначению на протяжении многих лет.</p>
<p style="clear: both"><img src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45292/1714325.jpg" /></p>
<p>Интересно, что если вы будете осведомлены о том, как удалить поверхностные дефекты, то легко сможете от них избавиться. К примеру, пятна вследствие термического воздействия, мелкие сколы или трещинки легко удалить при помощи шлифовки, а швы просто подклеить. Только для проведения такой работы придется пригласить мастера.</p>
<p>Если вам нужна каменная мойка для кухни, плюсы и минусы конструкции учитывайте при выборе модели. Не пренебрегайте консультацией специалиста. Интересуйтесь, как выбрать каменную мойку для кухни, как правильно ухаживать за изделием из искусственного камня и кому из производителей отдать предпочтение.</p>
<h2>Искусственный камень VS нержавейка</h2>
<p>Каменная мойка для кухни, отзывы о которой формируют подробную характеристику продукта с точки зрения покупателя, занимает первые позиции в рейтинге кухонной сантехники.</p>
<p>Эксперты выделяют семь основных причин, по которым каменная мойка лучше нержавеющей:</p>
<p> <ol>
  <li>Разнообразие цветов и фактур.</li>
  <li>Стильный дизайн.</li>
  <li>По сравнению с нержавеющей мойкой раковина из искусственного камня не создает шума во время падения струи воды.</li>
  <li>Каменная мойка глубже, а значит, удобнее стальной раковины.</li>
  <li>Разводы и брызги малозаметны на поверхности камня, в то время как на металле видна каждая капля.</li>
  <li>Возможность использовать современные смесители для каменных моек для кухни. К примеру, на двойную мойку можно монтировать смеситель с коротким изливом и лейкой-душем для мытья овощей.</li>
  <li>В структуре искусственного камня отсутствуют поры, поэтому грязь и пищевые запахи не впитываются.</li>
  <li>Искусственный камень (кварц и гранит) не поддаются выцветанию.</li>
  <li>Современная технология производства позволяет создавать мойки для кухни из искусственного камня, презентуя их как экологичный и безопасный продукт.</p></ol>
<p style="clear: both"><img src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45292/1714331.jpg" /></p>
<h2>Недостатки каменной мойки</h2>
<p>В мире не существует такого товара, который не обладал бы недостатками. По мнению покупателей, каменная мойка для кухни (отзывы это подтверждают) характеризуется такими недостатками:</p>
<p> <ol>
  <li>Существенно завышенная цена по сравнению с моделями, изготовленными из нержавеющей стали и обладающими аналогичными конфигурационными характеристиками.</li>
  <li>Недорогие модели моек редко оказываются качественными, поэтому на приобретении такой сантехники сэкономить не удастся.</li>
  <li>Высокий риск покупки подделки.</li>
</ol>
