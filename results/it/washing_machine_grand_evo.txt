<p> The Grand'O Evo washing machines are equipped with the innovative Mix Power System. This unique system allows clothes to be washed at a minimum temperature of 20 ° C with a result like 40 ° C. * At this temperature, clothes of different colors and different fabric compositions, washed together, remain the same color, the colors will not fade, regardless of the number of washings. And even the most delicate fabric will remain intact. You no longer need to sort your laundry by color - you can wash everything together. The Mix Power System delivers great washing results while saving up to 60% energy and 15% water savings. * </p>
<p> How does the Mix Power System work? It creates a concentrated detergent mixture, dissolving the detergent 100%, and injects it under pressure into the drum, directly onto the laundry. The mixture evenly and intensively penetrates between the fibers of the fabric, improving the quality of washing. And then, during the rinsing process, the system creates an additional mechanical effect, supplying clean water under pressure to the laundry and washing out the smallest particles of detergent. You can easily change the intensity of the mechanical effect on the fabric, as well as the program time, depending on the degree of soiling of the laundry. </p>
<p> The electronic control of the Grand Evo will allow you to easily adjust the washing time, energy and water consumption. It is enough to indicate the type of fabric, and the machine itself will optimize the washing process. She will independently select the drum rotation algorithm, temperature and spin speed suitable for the given laundry. </p>
<p> And you will be surprised how easy it is to manage your time with 3 quick programs with a duration of 44, 30 and even 14 minutes. </p>
<p> Of course, Candy never changes the Italian style. Washing machines of the Grand Evo series are very laconic, without sharp corners, in a pleasant color with a large loading door with a diameter of 35 cm, which makes it easy to load and unload things. And the handle for opening the hatch with the highest position - 75 cm from the floor, which has no analogues in other manufacturers, is made in the "automobile" style. It will allow a person of any height to open the car door comfortably and practically without bending over. </p>
<p> An additional 10-year warranty covering the main components of the Grand'O Evo washing machine: motor, heating element, pump and drive belt will be a pleasant surprise for buyers. ** </p>
<p> Recommended retail price from 19,990 rubles. </p>
<p> * Compared to the standard 40 ° C cotton program in Candy washing machines without Mix Power System </p>

<p> Repair of the Candy Grand Evo washing machine. <br /> Maybe someone will come in handy)) </p>
<p> So, patient: Candy Grand Evo <br /> Illness: Knocks out error E3 and does not drain the water. <br /> Diagnosis: Mechanical blockage of the pump. </p>
<p> In general, my wife said that my mother-in-law had a buggy machine. <br /> Well, it doesn't happen to anyone, I thought, we'll fix it. <br /> Google gave out that the E3 error is a drain error, it knocks out if 3 minutes don't it turns out to drain water due to blockage and / or breakdown of the pump. </p>
<p> I arrived, poked at the typewriter. It really doesn't drain the water. <br /> I somehow pumped out the water with rags, and then began to drain the filter-sump. <br /> There was nasty mucus in the sump, but there were no coins or paper clips that I expected to see. . </p>
<p> I turned on the typewriter - and the pump does not even think to spin. <br /> That means something is wrong with it. </p>
<p> The second time I was smarter, I put the machine in the shower, where I calmly poured out the rest of the water, after which the patient was laid on his side. </p>
<p style = "clear: both"> <img src = "https://a.d-cd.net/2a854b1s-960.jpg" /> </p>
<p> Pumps are only accessible from below. <br /> Yes, to the pumps. There are two of them. <br /> One is for recycling (that's why things smelled like a swamp), the second is for draining. </p>
<p> I threw off the rubber pipes, there are self-clamping clamps, nothing complicated. </p>
