<p> Creating a comfortable home atmosphere is one of the main tasks of an automation system. The uses of incense have been known since ancient times.

And if you are building your automation system on devices from the Chinese company Xiaomi, then you will be interested in the <strong> Viomi Cloud Aromatherapy Machine </strong> air fragrance. </p>
<p> In shape, the new device resembles a pear, and is made in a proprietary matte white plastic. Small size and interesting shape will allow the device to fit perfectly into any interior. </p>
