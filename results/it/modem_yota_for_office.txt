<h1> Equipment for connecting the office to the LTE network. </h1>
<p> Many companies are faced with the problem of organizing Internet access in the office. The most common problem is the inflated prices of monopoly providers serving business centers. LTE network is an excellent solution that allows you to provide your office with Internet access for little money - from 450 rubles per month (the cost depends on the speed and provider). </p>
<h2> Small office (3-5 people) </h2>
<p> Companies that consume a small amount of traffic (10-20 GB per month) can safely use a set of equipment for MegaFon 4G. The provider uses the same base stations as Yota, but has traffic restrictions, compensated for by the high quality of communication. <br /> Yota equipment kits are ideal for those who need completely unlimited Internet. </p>
<p> To connect a small office to 4G Internet, it is enough to purchase a simple kit consisting of an LTE modem and a Router. It will allow you to distribute the Internet to several computers. But before buying, it should be borne in mind that not everywhere there is a sufficient signal level to ensure a high-speed and stable connection. <br /> The following typical problems and solutions can be distinguished: </p>
<p> <b> 1. High or medium signal strength. </b> </p>
<p> With a good signal level, it is enough to use an LTE modem in conjunction with a router. </p>
